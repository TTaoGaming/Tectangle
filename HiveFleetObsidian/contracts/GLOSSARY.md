# HFO Glossary - Evolution & Orchestration

- Jungian Archetypes: classical patterns of persona (e.g., Innocent, Warrior) guiding interpretable roles.
- Elements: symbolic traits (e.g., Fire, Water) used as compact dimensions for variation.
- Keywords: short handles for tactics/intent (e.g., reorient, ignite) driving selection prompts.
- Evidence: observations/feedback logged by the Scribe (success/failure/score, trace refs).
- ELO/TrueSkill/BTL: rating systems to estimate champion strength from outcomes.
- (Contextual) Bandits: online selection under uncertainty; Dueling Bandits for pairwise comparisons.
- Quality-Diversity (MAP-Elites): search for many high-performing, diverse behaviors; archive "elites."
- CMA-ES/PBT: evolution strategies for continuous search / population-based training.
- MPC/HTN/Options: planning across time horizons (control/Hierarchical Task Networks/hierarchical RL).
- Distillation: compress ensemble/elite behaviors into compact policies for deployment.
