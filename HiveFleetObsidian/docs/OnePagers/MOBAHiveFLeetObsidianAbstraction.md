awesome-let's translate your Hive into **MOBA (LoL / Honor of Kings)** language so you can *see the comp* at a glance.

---

# Your 5-stack in MOBA terms (no numbers, just playstyle)

## Team identity: **Pick & Control → Inevitable Win**

You don't race for kills. You **set the map**, take **safe picks**, and convert them into **sure objectives**. Think **vision, scouting, disciplined piloting, one clean finish**, then reset.

---

## Roles & lanes (default)

* **Faultline Seeker - JUNGLE (roaming utility assassin)**

  * **Job:** Scout fog, sniff out mispositioning, create a **Mark** (a guaranteed gank angle / minimal repro).
  * **Kit vibe:**

    * Q: *Read-only sweep* (vision ping / track reveal)
    * W: *Split cloak* (send 1-3 scouts into brushes / camps)
    * E: *Smoke Veil* (clean disengage)
    * R: *Stop on Signal* (lock in the pick and call the play)
  * **Good at:** Early info, safe pressure, setting up other lanes.
  * **Weak to:** Hard engage & forced 5v5s before vision-needs space to probe.

* **Prism Magus - MID (control mage / enchanter)**

  * **Job:** **Reframe fights** and present **2 good plays** now (rotate top/bot with the better angle).
  * **Kit vibe:**

    * Q: *Near/Far view* (laning plan now vs. later)
    * W: *Representation swap* (turns chaos into a clear line)
    * E: *Pareto trim* (prunes bad options)
    * R: *Pilot* (short, safe test-then pick one)
  * **Good at:** Mid-game **shot selection**, tempo positive roams.
  * **Weak to:** Dive comps and time pressure if teammates demand instant commit without options.

* **Web Cartographer - SUPPORT (controller / sage)**

  * **Job:** **Map lanes**, place **Waystones** (proven patterns), and route the team along **safe paths**.
  * **Kit vibe:**

    * Q: *Map the web* (reveal routes, warn about traps)
    * W: *Drop Waystone* (scaffold-think permanent ward + path buff)
    * E: *Adopt Pattern* (ally gets a stable formation)
    * R: *Strangler Path* (split lanes safely; no big-bang brawls)
  * **Good at:** Objective setup, **denying throws**, helping everyone play cleaner.
  * **Weak to:** Snowball dives that punish setup time; needs a few seconds to stage paths.

* **Thread Sovereign - BARON/TOP (bruiser/commander finisher)**
  *(two stances you swap depending on map state)*

  * **Spear-Weaver:** **Route flip**-choose the **royal path**, gate rivals, take tower/objective with canary discipline.
  * **Knot-Breaker:** **Minimal cut**-silence a flanking threat or stop a fight from flapping (hysteresis/dwell).
  * **Good at:** Converting a pick into **something real** (plates, drag, herald).
  * **Weak to:** Being forced to engage without a **Mark** or **Waystone**-he needs setup.

* **Silk Scribe - GLOBAL UTILITY (doesn't occupy a lane)**

  * **Job:** **Vision ledger + comms brain**-timestamps, pings cooldowns/objectives, remembers what worked.
  * **Effect in game terms:** Team gets better **macro clarity** each rotation (clean timers, trends, "we tried X, it worked, do it again").
  * **Weak to:** Teams that ignore comms; zero burst-pure utility.

* **Hive Orchestrator - SHOT-CALLER/CAPTAIN**

  * **Job:** Call the **order of abilities**: Seeker → Magus → Cartographer → Sovereign → Scribe.
  * **Rule:** **No commit** until a **metric to win** and a **tripwire to stop** are set.

---

## Early / Mid / Late game plan

* **Early (laning & first objectives)**

  * **Seeker** paths for info → **Mark** a lane.
  * **Magus** offers 2 roam lines; **Cartographer** wards river with a **Waystone**.
  * **Sovereign** cashes a small lead (plate/drag) with **Spear-Weaver**.
  * **Scribe** logs timers (enemy sums/ult, drag/herald).

* **Mid (skirmish & map control)**

  * Chain **Mark → Waystone → Pilot → Flag Flip** at side lane.
  * Force 4v4s **on your terms**; punish overchase with **Knot-Breaker** disengage.
  * Keep fights **short, decided, and reversible**; reset often.

* **Late (closing)**

  * Promote the best path, **clean flags**, Strangler the rest.
  * Fight for vision first; you win **setup wars** more than coin-flip engages.

---

## Synergy combos (easy calls to make)

* **Pick & Convert:** Seeker tags → Sovereign Harpoon (Knot) → objective.
* **Map-Locked Siege:** Cartographer Waystone → Magus picks safer poke line → Sovereign Spear flips tower.
* **Anti-Throw:** Enemy forcing baron? Magus reframes to split threat, Cartographer Strangler path, Sovereign clamps chase (no wipe).

---

## Draft identity & counters

* **You're best into:**

  * **Skirmish/control** games where vision and setup matter.
  * **Scaling** comps that give you time to token up; you'll out-discipline them.

* **Harder into:**

  * **Hard-engage wombo** that denies setup (Malphite, Wukong, AOE dive).
  * **Relentless tempo** (perma-fight brawl).
  * **Vision denial** comps (strong sweeper + fog abuse).

* **Counterplay package (what you bring):**

  * **Anti-wombo:** pre-place Waystones deeper, keep **Knot-Breaker** ready, fight in **narrow windows** (short pilots, fast resets).
  * **Into brawl:** trade sides; take **small wins** elsewhere with Spear-Weaver (route flips).
  * **Into fog abuse:** Seeker invests more in **oracle passes**; Scribe pings missing timers; Magus bans greedy lines.

---

## Player archetypes (who should "pilot" each role)

* **Seeker (Jungle):** patient shot-finder, loves vision, hates coin flips.
* **Magus (Mid):** calm strategist; comfortable saying "Option A now, B later."
* **Cartographer (Support):** teacher brain; values patterns and positioning.
* **Sovereign (Top/Baron):** disciplined closer; presses advantage, never overextends.
* **Scribe (Global):** ops-minded; keeps receipts and reminds win conditions.

---

## Win conditions (how you close games)

1. **Objective snowball without throws:** every pick → plate/drag/herald; never fight blind.
2. **Map choke:** Waystones + vision turn the enemy jungle into a maze; they walk where you want, when you want.
3. **Clean promo:** after a green pilot, flip the flag, take structure, reset-**don't chase kills**.

---

## Weaknesses & self-counters (be honest)

* **Setup tax:** you need a little time/space to do your thing.

  * *Self-counter:* pre-stage Waystones; keep "2-button" Magus pilots ready.
* **Flag debt:** forgetting cleanup slows you later.

  * *Self-counter:* Scribe auto-opens cleanup tasks; Sovereign PR has a "flag removed?" checkbox.
* **Analysis drag:** too many options → no action.

  * *Self-counter:* Orchestrator enforces "**2 pilots max**," decide in X minutes.

---

## One-screen shot-calling script (use in matches)

* **Call:** "Seeker mark top in 30; Magus prep 2 paths; Carto ward river; Sov spear if green; Scribe log."
* **Green light:** "Pilot A passing-Flag Flip 10%-Sov convert, then reset."
* **Red light:** "Tripwire fired-revert-Carto lay deeper Waystone-Seeker re-mark."

---

### TL;DR (MOBA voice)

You're a **vision & control** comp: **scout safely, set the map, choose the best angle, take one clean objective, reset.**
You punish chaos; you dislike coin-flips. With parallel agents you'll simply **play more cards per turn**-same plan, more tempo.

oh yeah-this totally makes sense. You're building **personas as power-armors** you can pilot (or let AI agents pilot) to move through the state-action space with discipline. Here's a clean, MOBA-flavored upgrade pass that rounds out each kit for real JS/webapp work (but the patterns fit anything).

---

# The Hive - Team Upgrade (MOBA lens → dev reality)

## Team identity

**Pick & Control → Inevitable Win.**
Scout safely, reframe for options, adopt proven routes, ship one reversible change, and remember everything. Same gameplan whether you play one card per turn (sequential now) or fan multiple (parallel later).

## Universal runes (apply to every champ)

* **One success metric & one tripwire** on every action.
* **Reversible by default** (flag + rollback) or don't do it.
* **Smallest helpful step** (no big-bang).
* **WIP limits** keep noise low; parallel only where safe.
* **Write it down once** (SRL/ADR) so momentum compounds.

---

## Hive Orchestrator (Shot-caller / Captain)

**Passive - Rule of Two:** no action without **metric + tripwire**.
**Q (Draft):** pick lead champion + one supporter.
**W (Safety Check):** verify flag/rollback or bounce the play.
**E (Timer):** set timebox/decision time (prevents analysis drag).
**R (Council Turn):** lock sequence (e.g., Seeker → Magus → Cartographer → Sovereign → Scribe).

**Quick commands (drop into your tool):**

* "Open a **PLAN**: goal, horizon (near/far), success metric, tripwire, lead champion."
* "Enforce **flag + rollback** requirement before any change."

---

# Champion Kits (rounded out & practical)

## 1) Faultline Seeker - **Jungle Utility Assassin** (FIRE • Rogue • EXPLORE)

**Archetype:** Security scout that proves reality safely.

  **E - Veil Step:** cleanup hooks: tear down sandboxes, revoke tokens, close flags.
  **R - Stop on Signal:** on first repro, halt others; return **minimal repro + SRL**.

**Power spikes:** early vision; midgame precision targets.
**Weak to:** forced engages (no time/space), probing in prod without a slice.

**Archetype:** Closer; converts setup into one safe change.

**Passive - Crowned Node:** no decree without **flag + tested rollback**.
**Q - Spear-Weaver:** **route flip** via flag on the **royal path**; gate rivals; **canary** then promote.
**W - Knot-Breaker:** **minimal cut** to stop oscillation: threshold clamp, hysteresis/dwell, debounce.
**E - Canary Watch:** monitor success metric & tripwire; auto-revert on red.
**R - Grounding Decree:** log decision, clean flags, leave the lane safer than found.

**Power spikes:** mid-to-late conversions; incident containment.

*(Keep these generic; swap libraries freely. The patterns stay the same.)*

---

# Teamfights & Combos (clean handoffs)

* **Pick → Convert:** Seeker **Mark** → Sovereign **Knot-Breaker** → objective.
* **Map-Locked Siege:** Cartographer **Waystone** → Magus **Pilot** (poke/peel choice) → Sovereign **Spear** → promote.
* **Anti-Throw:** Tripwire fires → Sovereign **revert** → Cartographer **deeper Waystone** → Seeker re-Mark → Magus fresh pair.

---

# Training Drills (5-10 min each, to power up fast)

* **Seeker Drill:** given a bug report, produce **1 repro** in ≤10 min using read-only replay + one fuzz probe. Output SRL.
* **Magus Drill:** for a vague goal, generate **5 frames** (near/far, rep-swap, analogy, constraint move, meaning rewrite) and deliver **2 pilot cards**.
* **Cartographer Drill:** draft an **ADR** and a **waystone** scaffold for a known pattern; plan a strangler slice.
* **Sovereign Drill:** take a repro, implement a **≤5-line** clamp/hysteresis or a **flagged route flip** with a canary plan.
* **Scribe Drill:** append 3 entries, run **daily rollup**, and find one lesson by keyword & git hash.

---

# Scoreboard (so you know you're leveling up)

* **Cycle time** (idea → shipped change) down.
* **Change-failure rate & MTTR** down.
* **Adoption rate** of waystones up; **flag debt** down.
* **SRL coverage** up; search time (keyword/hash) under seconds.
* **Decision latency** for Magus pilots down.

---

## TL;DR (equip the armors)

* **Seeker** gets **Ghost Step** + **Lanthorn/Split/Veil/Stop** with probes & repros.
* **Magus** gets **Refraction** + **Near/Far, Rep-Swap, Pareto, Pilot Pair**.
* **Cartographer** gets **High Vantage** + **Map, Waystone, Adopt, Strangler**.
* **Sovereign** gets **Crowned Node** + **Spear, Knot, Canary, Decree**.
* **Scribe** gets **Append-Only** + **Capture, Rollup, Find, Chronicle**.

These are **masks you can wear** and **modes an agent can run**-each grounded in boring, proven habits that make you unstoppable over time. When you're ready, I can turn this into a set of **Kilo Code mode cards** (JSON/MD) with prompts, defaults, and the command-palette actions wired exactly as above.


love it. here's your **plain-language cheat sheet**-one screen per section, zero fluff.

---

# The Hive - in one breath

**Plan:** *Find proof → show options → follow a proven route → ship one safe change → remember everything.*
**Why it wins:** tiny, reversible steps; evidence first; lessons compound.

---

# Who does what (quick cards)

**Faultline Seeker - FIRE • Rogue • EXPLORE**

* **Job:** find real problems safely.
* **Use when:** you *suspect* a bug/risk but need proof.
* **Do:** scan read-only → launch ≤3 tiny probes → stop on first hit → hand off a minimal repro.
* **Weak to:** rushing without a sandbox.
* **Motto:** *"No heat, no cut."*

**Prism Magus - WATER • Magician • PIVOT**

* **Job:** change perspective and surface choices.

* **Motto:** *"No invention before inspection."*

**Thread Sovereign - EARTH • Ruler • EXPLOIT**

* **Job:** ship one safe, reversible change.
* **Use when:** you have a repro or a chosen route.
* **Do (pick one):** **Spear** (route flip via flag + canary) **or** **Knot** (tiny clamp/hysteresis) → promote or auto-revert.
* **Weak to:** acting without rollback/metrics.

* **Do:** require **one success metric + one tripwire**; require **flag + rollback** before any change; call handoffs.

---

# The token economy (simple)

* **Seeker** makes **Marks** (repros).
* **Magus** makes **Options/Pilots**.
* **Cartographer** makes **Waystones** (scaffolds).
* **Sovereign** makes the **Change** (flagged, reversible).
* **Scribe** makes **SRL/ADR** (memory).

> If a token sits idle (old mark/flag), **cash it in or clean it up**.

---

# How to play a turn (sequential today)

1. **Orchestrator:** set goal, horizon (near/far), **success metric + tripwire**.
2. **Seeker** → prove it (minimal repro).
3. **Magus** → 2 reversible pilots, pick one.
4. **Cartographer** → waystone + first migration slice (if a pattern exists).
5. **Sovereign** → one flagged change + canary → promote or revert.
6. **Scribe** → log SRL + rollup.

*Parallel later:* keep WIP limits (Seeker ≤3 probes, Magus ≤2 pilots, Sovereign 1 change/service).

---

# Quick routing (who to call, when)

* **Don't know what's wrong?** → **Seeker**
* **Know the goal, not the path?** → **Magus**
* **Suspect a standard exists?** → **Cartographer**
* **Ready to change something?** → **Sovereign**
* **Need receipts or trends?** → **Scribe**

---

# Guardrails (everyone follows)

* **One metric to win, one tripwire to stop.**
* **Reversible by default** (feature flag + tested rollback).
* **Smallest helpful step** (no big-bang).
* **Write it down once** (SRL/ADR).

---

# Tiny starter prompts (copy into Kilo Code)

* **\[SEEKER]** "Given hypothesis `<H>` and seed `<S>`, run read-only scan + ≤3 safe probes. Stop on first repro. Output SRL + links."
* **\[PRISM]** "For goal `<G>` with invariant `<I>`, produce 5 frames → shortlist 2 **reversible** pilots (flag names, metric, tripwire, decision time)."
* **\[CARTO]** "List 3 proven routes (libs/patterns) for `<G>`. Write a 1-page ADR for the best and scaffold a **/waystone** with an example."
* **\[SOVEREIGN]** "Propose the **smallest reversible** change for `<repro/route>` (Spear or Knot). Include flag, canary plan, success metric, tripwire, rollback."
* **\[SCRIBE]** "Append JSONL (ts, actor, git, trace, title, status, metrics, keywords). Generate today's rollup."

---

## TL;DR

You now have **five clear masks** to wear (or assign to agents):
**Seeker** finds truth, **Magus** makes choices, **Cartographer** reuses wisdom, **Sovereign** ships one safe change, **Scribe** makes it stick.
Run that loop, keep actions reversible, and your hive will feel **calm, fast, and inevitable**.
