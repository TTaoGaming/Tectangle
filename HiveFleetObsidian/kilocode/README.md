Kilo Code Modes - Hive Fleet Obsidian

This folder contains copy‑paste templates to create Kilo Code modes for this repo. Each mode file mirrors Kilo's "Create Mode" form: Name, Slug, Short Description, When to Use, Available Tools, Role Definition, and Custom Instructions.

How to use
- Open KILO CODE → Modes → Create Mode.
- Copy the blocks from a mode file in `kilocode/modes/` into the form fields.
- Save as Project mode so it stays bound to this repo.

Included templates
- HFO Orchestrator: council‑of‑4 coordinator that convenes → delegates → executes → reconvenes.
- Thread Sovereign (Exploit): decisive single‑seat (Earth/Ruler) that lands one safe, reversible step.
- Faultline Seeker (Explore): risk‑first micro‑tests (Fire/Rogue) that find cracks fast with clear stop rules.
 - Prism Magus (Pivot): reframes with smallest viable swap behind a flag; compare and keep the winner.
 - Web Cartographer (Reorient): map entrypoints/links; name the seam; propose the smallest adapter.
 - Silk Scribe (Memory): log snapshots and run daily/weekly/monthly reviews.

Usage
- Use HFO Orchestrator as the primary chat mode.
- Call individual champion modes directly when you want a focused seat voice and deterministic output shape.

Conventions
- Keep responses deterministic in structure (sections) while allowing content variety.
- Prefer reversible steps and health gates (frozen smoke, duplicates, MISS count).
