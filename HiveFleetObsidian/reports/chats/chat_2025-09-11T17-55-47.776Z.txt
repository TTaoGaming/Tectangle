Silk Scribe: WARNING board stale (age ~3713.65m) - update problem & metric before deep counsel.
TTao: Problem: (unset). Let's keep it green and simple.
Thread Sovereign: Run hive:daily and fill Board; commit one safe improvement (e.g., overview/standardize turn) (Win: dup==0 && smoke:pass && frozen:pass && miss==0)
Faultline Seeker: Design 1-3 micro-tests for riskiest assumption in Board; run replay on a new short trace (Stop: Stop rule hit (signal or timeout) on at least one probe)
Prism Magus: Run prism_reframe.mjs with goal from Board to compare baseline vs new angle (Keep when EV_new > EV_old within constraints; no regressions)
Web Cartographer: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step
Silk Scribe: Logged chat | counsel: HiveFleetObsidian/reports/turns/turn_2025-09-11T17-55-47.479Z.json
Help: Ask anything. Controls - tone=casual|formal, rounds=1|2, --strict, --council, --provider <p>, --counsel-file <path> | --counsel-stdin, seed=<text>. Private: sovereign decide | prism plan. Edit BOARD.current.txt to steer.
