TTao: Problem: (unset). We steer by simple, green checks.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Strike the decisive seam. (Sun Tzu: win without fighting) Cut Pinchâ†’Hex adapter (small bridge that fits a port) seam (ports/adapters). Ship only if frozen stays green. OODA (observe-orient-decide-act).
Faultline Seeker: Probe: Design 1-3 micro-tests for riskiest assumption in Board; run replay on a new short trace. Stop when Stop rule hit (signal or timeout) on at least one probe.
Prism Magus: [Keep the aim; change the path.] Keep the aim; change the path: Use an adapter, not a rewrite. Win: demo works today.
Web Cartographer: [Show the map. Name the seam. Choose the smallest next path.] Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step. Smallest step first. (Entrypoint scan: seed from README/index/H1)
