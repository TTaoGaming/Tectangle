TTao: Prompt: deck test. Let's keep it green and simple.
Thread Sovereign: Hello. I'm Thread Sovereign - I cut indecision; we move one safe step.
Faultline Seeker: Hello. I'm Faultline Seeker - I probe the crack that breaks assumptions fastest.
Prism Magus: Hello. I'm Prism Magus - I change the path, not the goal; I turn complicated into constrained.
Web Cartographer: Hello. I'm Web Cartographer - I reveal the map so we can choose a better path.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Daily health + one reversible improvement OODA
Faultline Seeker: I'll run a quick probe: Design 1-3 micro-tests and replay a short trace. If not we hit signal or timeout, we stop and adjust.
Prism Magus: Same aim, new path: Use an adapter, not a rewrite. Good when demo works today.
Web Cartographer: Map says: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step - smallest step first. (Entrypoint scan: seed from README/index/H1)
