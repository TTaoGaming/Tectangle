TTao: Prompt: TectangleHexagonal: next step. We steer by simple, green checks.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Strike the decisive seam. Record. Seize the decisive point (small effort, big shift): Run hive:daily and fill Board; commit one safe improvement (e.g., overview/standardize turn). Ship only if frozen stays green. OODA (observe-orient-decide-act).
Faultline Seeker: Probe: Design 1-3 micro-tests for riskiest assumption in Board; run replay on a new short trace. Stop when Stop rule hit (signal or timeout) on at least one probe.
Prism Magus: Same goal-Run prism_reframe.mjs with goal from Board to compare baseline vs new angle. Keep the winner.
Web Cartographer: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step. Smallest step first.
