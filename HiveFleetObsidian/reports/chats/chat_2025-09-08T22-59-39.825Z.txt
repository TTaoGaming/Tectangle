TTao: Problem: Make HFO sailworthy: deterministic counsel, plain-language voices, portable pack.. Let's keep it green and simple.
Thread Sovereign: Hello. I'm Thread Sovereign - I cut indecision; we move one safe step.
Faultline Seeker: Hello. I'm Faultline Seeker - I probe the crack that breaks assumptions fastest.
Prism Magus: Hello. I'm Prism Magus - I change the path, not the goal; I turn complicated into constrained.
Web Cartographer: Hello. I'm Web Cartographer - I reveal the map so we can choose a better path.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Daily health + one reversible improvement
Faultline Seeker: I'll shake the seam: Design 1-3 micro-tests and replay a short trace
Prism Magus: Mirror-mask suggests: Use an adapter, not a rewrite
Web Cartographer: Map says: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step
Prism Magus: Mirror-mask suggests: Ship a 1‑hour demo; stage the refactor
Prism Magus: Reason: evidence now beats perfection
Prism Magus: Win: user can pinch→play
Thread Sovereign: Let's move: Final: Daily health + one reversible improvement Ship only if frozen stays green.
TTao: Sounds good. I'll run: npm run hive:daily
