TTao: Prompt: Council: Redesign HFO deck so all cards fit. Use images in HiveFleetObsidian/docs: (none). Propose a consistent schema (front-matter, sections, tokens), add image fields, and a pipeline to index both champion and fleet cards. Aim: mnemonic deck to steer state-action space with scouts/adapters/frozen gate. Give next steps.. Let's keep it green and simple.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Daily health + one reversible improvement OODA
Faultline Seeker: I'll run a quick probe: Design 1-3 micro-tests and replay a short trace. If not we hit signal or timeout, we stop and adjust.
Faultline Seeker: Signal check: Design 1-3 micro-tests and replay a short trace. We call it if we hit signal or timeout.
Prism Magus: Same aim, new path: Use an adapter, not a rewrite. Good when demo works today.
Prism Magus: Keep the goal; change the route: Use an adapter, not a rewrite. Win: demo works today.
Web Cartographer: Map says: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step - smallest step first. (Entrypoint scan: seed from README/index/H1)
Web Cartographer: Seam named: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step. We step light. (Entrypoint scan: seed from README/index/H1)
Prism Magus: Same aim, new path: Ship a 1‑hour demo; stage the refactor. Good when user can pinch→play.
Thread Sovereign: Small, safe cut: Final: Daily health + one reversible improvement Ship only if frozen stays green.
TTao: Sounds good. I'll run: npm run hive:daily
