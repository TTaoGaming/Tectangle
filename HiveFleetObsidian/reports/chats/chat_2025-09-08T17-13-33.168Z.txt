TTao: Problem: (unset). Let's keep it green and simple.
Thread Sovereign: Decide. Strike the decisive seam. (Sun Tzu: win without fighting) Daily health + one reversible improvement. Ship only if frozen stays green. OODA (observe-orient-decide-act).
Faultline Seeker: I'll run a quick probe: Design 1-3 micro-tests for riskiest assumption in Board; run replay on a new short trace. If we don't see Stop rule hit (signal or timeout) on at least one probe, we stop and regroup.
Prism Magus: Same aim, new path: Use an adapter, not a rewrite. Calls it good when demo works today.
Web Cartographer: Map says: Adopt ports/adapters for the next seam; land the smallest first step - smallest step first. (Entrypoint scan: seed from README/index/H1)
