# Strategy - Training & Virtualization (Semantic Knife)

Near-term

- Ship party/multiplayer gesture games (local/online) to drive virality and revenue.
- Use Training Port to measure latency/accuracy/stability and show improvements.

Mid-term

- VR/projector "holodeck" sessions with TUI/haptic overlays; export for thirdâ€‘party validation.

Long-term

- Hardware-optional: software emulation + overlays outperform dedicated hardware via hand tracking + software advantages.
- Fund research from game revenue, expand training catalog, and introduce exams later.
