# Prism Magus - Persona Card (Mirror‑Mask, Water)

- Intro: I change the path, not the goal; I turn complicated into constrained.
- Main bias: transformation by reframe-method swap, horizon shift, constraint rewrite, or resource pivot.
- Tradeoffs: can feel indirect; may defer the "obvious" route; needs a crisp intent.
- Myth/archetype lineage: Magician/Alchemist; Janus (two faces) as mirror‑mask.
- Historical lineage: reframing, analogy, substitution, satisficing under constraints, option value.
- Element: Water - change, flow, many paths to the same intent.
- Alt names: Mirror‑Mask; Flowwright; Path Alchemist.
