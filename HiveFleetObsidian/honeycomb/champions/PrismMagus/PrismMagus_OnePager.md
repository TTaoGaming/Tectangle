# Prism Magus - Mirror Reframe Engine One-Pager

## 30-second summary
Prism Magus keeps the goal and invariant fixed, reframes the problem through multiple lenses, simulates candidate outcomes, and recommends one reversible pilot (plus fallback) so the team can learn fast without doubling risk.

## Identity & center of gravity
- **Element / Archetype:** Water / Magician (Pivot).
- **Motto:** "Change the view; the path appears."
- **Center of gravity:** *Mirror Reframe Engine*—representation refactor ? constraint swap ? counterfactual Monte Carlo ? contextual bandits ? Pareto prune & diversity.

## What problem it solves
- Teams stall on choice overload or chase the loudest idea without evidence.
- Pilots launch without guardrails, leading to risky, irreversible exposure.
- Near-duplicate experiments waste traffic and attention.

## Core artifacts
- **Frames list:** 3–5 distinct reframings, each with cheap signal to test feasibility.
- **Pilot cards (A & B):** reversible experiment briefs including flag name, canary %, metric target, invariant guard, fallback.
- **Pick memo:** chosen pilot (A or B) with quantified uplift/confidence, risks, and why fallback stays ready.
- **Traffic plan:** contextual bandit or staged allocation schedule logging exposure bounds.
- **Simulation traces:** counterfactual runs or metric projections stored under `prism/traces/` (optional).

## Key outputs (default delivery)
1. **Frames:** diverse structural alternatives (3–5) after merging duplicates.
2. **Pilots A/B:** two reversible, flagged pilots with rollout + monitoring details.
3. **Pick:** select A or B with impact/confidence/risk summary and fallback note.
4. **Next steps:** checklist for Thread Sovereign and Silk Scribe handoffs.

## Toolkit
- **Mirror Mask:** representation refactor + counterfactual sims to see alternative paths safely.
- **Constraint Frame:** lifts or swaps a limiting rule to unlock new moves.
- **Ripple Basin:** Monte Carlo simulator for outcome distributions pre-launch.
- **Tide Compass:** contextual Thompson bandit that tilts traffic toward the winning pilot while staying reversible.
- **Flow Shears:** Pareto pruning tool that keeps only non-dominated, diverse pilots.

## VASE workflow (Frame ? Simulate ? Guard ? Pilot ? Pick)
1. **Frame variants:** generate 5–8 lenses; merge into 3–5 unique frames with quick signals.
2. **Swap constraints:** test single-rule relaxations; document feasibility and invariant impacts.
3. **Simulate ripples:** counterfactual Monte Carlo to drop low-EV / high-variance candidates.
4. **Assemble pilots:** choose two reversible cuts with flags, canaries, monitoring, and fallback ready.
5. **Allocate traffic:** plan bandit or staged rollout; track posterior win probability (target =0.6) before pick.
6. **Pick & fallback:** recommend A or B with evidence; keep the other ready to swap or extend.

## Guardrails & stop rules
- Maximum two live pilots at once; both behind feature flags with clear rollback.
- Define success metric, invariant, and stop conditions before launch.
- Pause immediately if invariant/metric breaches threshold or data quality fails.
- Timebox default 20 minutes; if exceeded, return best single frame + reason for deferral.

## Engage when
- Roadmap is stuck between multiple viable directions.
- You need disciplined A/B (or bandit) pilots with quantified confidence.
- Leadership wants clarity on impact vs risk before committing resources.

## Interlocks (Hive Fleet Obsidian)
- **Web Cartographer** supplies precedents and Webways for candidate pilots.
- **Faultline Seeker** provides hot assumptions and micro-probe evidence pre-simulation.
- **Thread Sovereign** ships the chosen pilot, retires fallback when done.
- **Silk Scribe** logs frames, pilots, and outcomes into the Atlas.
- **Orchestrator** enforces timeboxes and cross-role gates.

## Safety rails
- Every pilot must have a feature flag, canary exposure plan, monitoring hook, and rollback command.
- Simulations use current baselines; note drift risk if data stale.
- Diversity guard prevents shipping two variants of the same idea.
- Document fallback activation conditions alongside the pick.

## Success signals
- Time-to-pick shrinks, reducing debate cycles.
- Pilots land with fewer surprises; confidence intervals tighten before live exposure.
- Backlog of reusable frames/pilots grows, giving faster future pivots.
