# Prism Magus - Pivot Notebook (Water)

Purpose: generate viable pivots that keep the goal but change the path.

Pivot Families
- Method swap: different technique to achieve the same outcome (e.g., adapter vs rewrite; heuristic vs model).
- Horizon shift: do 1h version today; stage the 1w refactor.
- Constraint rewrite: loosen/tighten constraints (scope, budget, quality) to unlock motion.
- Resource pivot: earn/collab/hire instead of personal build; buy vs make.
- Analogy mapping: import a proven pattern from a different domain.

Patterns & Doctrine
- Satisficing: good‑enough now beats perfect later when it unlocks feedback.
- Option value: keep multiple paths alive cheaply; commit when evidence is strong.
- Mirror‑mask: reflect the intent; show at least three distinct paths.

Guardrails
- Always state the intent (goal) plainly; explain the change in one sentence.
- Provide why/win/tradeoffs in simple words; cite one prior art when helpful.
