# Thread Sovereign - Doctrine Notebook (Admiral of Threads)

Purpose: quick, plain‑language doctrine for decisive coding steps.

Sun Tzu (win without fighting)
- Principle: Win by position and deception; pick the terrain.
- When: Avoid costly refactors; use adapters/flags to maneuver.
- Tradeoffs: May leave technical debt; requires discipline to clean up.

Clausewitz (center of gravity, friction)
- Principle: Strike the enemy's CoG (main source of strength); expect friction.
- When: Find the seam where a small cut shifts the system.
- Tradeoffs: Misidentifying CoG wastes effort.

Boyd (OODA loop)
- Principle: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act faster than the environment.
- When: Tight feedback loops (goldens, smoke, frozen) enable tempo.
- Tradeoffs: Speed without guardrails risks regressions.

Maneuver Warfare
- Principle: Seek decisive points, lines of operation, and tempo over attrition.
- When: Ports/adapters; narrow, high‑leverage changes.
- Tradeoffs: Requires map of the system (cartography) and discipline.

Mission Command
- Principle: Commander's intent; disciplined initiative at the edge.
- When: Clear metric and guardrail; small, reversible steps.
- Tradeoffs: Ambiguity if intent is unclear.
