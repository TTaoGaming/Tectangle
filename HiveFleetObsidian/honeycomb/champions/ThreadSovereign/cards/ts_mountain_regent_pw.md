Abilities
- +1 - Decide: Choose the smallest reversible step (commit). Scry 1. If a gate was met this turn, you may draw a card, then discard a card.
- −2 - Set Guard: Until your next turn, if a check you control would fail by exactly 1, prevent that failure and delay the check (repeat it at the beginning of the next end step). Create a colorless Lesson token with "Sacrifice this: Scry 1."
- −6 - Resolve: You get an emblem with "Frozen - At the beginning of your end step, if a check you controlled succeeded this turn, create a colorless Frozen artifact token with 'Sacrifice this: Copy target step you controlled this turn.'"
- Static - Mountain Calm: Your allies' responses are capped at two lines each and are deduplicated (conversation stays crisp).

Keywords
- Gate - a release check such as Frozen or Shape that must be satisfied before shipping.
- Commit - take the smallest reversible step toward your current metric.

Flavor
