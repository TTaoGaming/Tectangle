# ADR | 2025-09-21T10:01:28Z | ww-2025-264

Context: Frequent September notes updates required a clear, audit-ready rollup at the file top with a revert path.

Decision: Prepend a timestamped rollup header to `TommyNotesSeptember2025.txt` and create a Webway note with SRL/ADR logs; update Silk Scribe indices.

Consequences: Rollup is easily discoverable and reversible; logs provide provenance; minimal code risk as it is documentation-only.
