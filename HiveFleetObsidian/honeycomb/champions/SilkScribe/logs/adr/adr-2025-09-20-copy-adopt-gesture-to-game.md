Context: We want a fast, reversible path to control existing HTML5 games with camera gestures, minimizing custom glue.

Decision: Adopt a baseline postMessage â†’ KeyboardEvent bridge behind HEX_INPUT_BRIDGE; extend with pointer/touch adapters later. Track latency and correctness via existing smokes and overlay verify.

Consequences: Quick demos without porting games; same-origin and focus constraints apply. Reversible via flag; low dependency footprint.
