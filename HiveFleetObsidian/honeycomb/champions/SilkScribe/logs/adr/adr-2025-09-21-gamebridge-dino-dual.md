Context: Need instant multiplayer harness using existing Dino runner; two instances driven by P1/P2 gestures.
Decision: Implement Dual Dino bridge hex with two iframes and route events; guard via e2e jump assertions.
Consequences: Immediate multiplayer validation; reusable for future demos; minimal maintenance.
