Context: We have a robust, palm-gated pinch with Kalman/hysteresis/angle/velocity confirmation and a seat magnet ghost for persistence. We want to reuse this with industry standards.

Decision: Add a guarded Pinch â†’ Standards Bridge. First implement an XR emulation adapter that emits WebXR-like select/selectend and exposes P1 curl; then add a minimal VRM retarget via Kalidokit and optional MPE mapping. All behind FEATURE_PINCH_STANDARDS_BRIDGE (sub: FEATURE_XR_EMU, FEATURE_VRM, FEATURE_MPE_BRIDGE).

Consequences: Keeps our logic, increases reach to XR/avatars/DAWs with minimal code. Small deps for VRM/MIDI. Clear revert via flag removal.
