Context: We need a quick, tryable demo that maps an obvious gesture to a game input on commodity webcams without new dependencies.
Decision: Keep a minimal heuristic (thumbâ€“pinky span vs wrist-center ratio with hysteresis) to trigger Space for Dino; mark with WEBWAY and add a plan to introduce a smoke test.
Consequences: Fast to ship and demo; potential false positives under extreme poses; clear path to upgrade to MediaPipe Tasks recognizer. No new deps; easy revert.
