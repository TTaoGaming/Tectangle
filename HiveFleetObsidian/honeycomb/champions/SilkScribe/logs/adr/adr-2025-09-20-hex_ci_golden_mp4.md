Context: Hex architecture and golden MP4 are core priorities; we need deterministic, reversible CI.
Decision: Adopt tiered CIâ€”PR runs hex:tier:commit; nightly runs full hex:goldens and visual snapshots. Add HEX_CI_STRICT to force full suite in PR when needed.
Consequences: Faster PR feedback with a strict-mode escape hatch; nightly surfaces visual regressions.
