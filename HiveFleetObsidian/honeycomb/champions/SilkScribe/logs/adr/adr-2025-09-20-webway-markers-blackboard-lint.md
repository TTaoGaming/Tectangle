# ADR | 2025-09-20T00:00:00Z | ww-2025-094

Context: We want devs landing in IHC v13/v14 to discover the master stigmergy blackboard quickly, and keep markdown style consistent with repo rules.

Decision: Inserted HTML comments with WEBWAY:ww-2025-094 pointer to /ObsidianBlackboard.md in integrated_hand_console_v13.html and v14.html. Normalized bullets in ObsidianBlackboard.md to dash style.

Consequences: Better discoverability and consistent lint. No runtime impact. Reversible by removing comments and reverting the markdown change.
