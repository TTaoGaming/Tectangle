Context: We aim to combine gesture-based proprioceptive play with ethical collectibles and future 3D showcase.
Decision: Ship a single-player Quick Draw with Closed_Fist detection; on win, add a local coin; expose test hooks; integrate into Arcade Hub.
Consequences: Fast to try and share; no backend dependency; clear path to pass-and-play and 3D cosmetics later.
