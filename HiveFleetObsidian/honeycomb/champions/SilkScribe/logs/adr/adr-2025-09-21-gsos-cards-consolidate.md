Context: GSOS had duplicate HTML; Camera demo window was not clickable; need consolidation and Card naming.
Decision: Remove duplicate HTML clone; add Camera Card that embeds v2 demo via iframe; set Card naming default; switch feature flag import to ports.
Consequences: Single source of truth; clickable camera; simpler testing; small iframe styling considerations.
