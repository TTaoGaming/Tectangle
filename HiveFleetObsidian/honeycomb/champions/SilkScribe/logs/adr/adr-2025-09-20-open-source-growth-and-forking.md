# ADR | 2025-09-20T05:55:00Z | ww-2025-088

Context: To enable longâ€‘term growth and forking, we need explicit docs and a CI guard beyond code.
Decision: Add CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT stubs, update README with fork/release guidance, and add a ci:oss-health check for docs + lint/unit.
Consequences: Low overhead; higher clarity for adopters; reversible.
