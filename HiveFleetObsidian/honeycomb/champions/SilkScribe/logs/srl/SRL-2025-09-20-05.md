focus: OPO runner visual polish + CI snapshot
hypotheses:
  - Material Design 3 tokens + seat-specific colors improve readability for quick operator review.
  - Snapshot smoke against the golden idle clip will guard UI regressions without manual spot checks.
observations: |
  Restyled the demo with MD3-inspired surfaces, radial accents, and seat cards that glow when present. Canvas now renders a midline, seat-coded landmarks (blue/red), wrist labels (Palm Open / Fist), and lighter tones for READY. Puppeteer snapshot script captures the layout after processing the idle golden clip.
decisions: |
  Keep OPO logic focused on lock (Palm Open >=3 frames) and fire (Close fist + reopen). Use JSONL frames + PNG snapshot for CI artifacts. Document predictive latency idea for future work.
next_actions:
  - Explore wrist velocity / predictive window using the state transitions.
  - Wire snapshot script into nightly visual tier alongside existing golden checks.
metrics_snapshot:
  fps_median: TBD
  false_fire_per_min: 0
  missed_fire_per_min: 0
notes: |
  Snapshot path: September2025/TectangleFSMRunner/out/golden.two_hands_idle.v1.opo.snapshot.png. Telemetry JSONL includes seat state, streak counters, and handedness for downstream analytics.
