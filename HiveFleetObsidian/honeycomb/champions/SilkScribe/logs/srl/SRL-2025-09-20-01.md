focus: OPO clutch stability (Recognizer)
hypotheses:
  - OPO + K=4 + 0.8/0.6 + 180ms cooldown will keep false-fires <1%/min.
observations: |
  Laptop cam 720p/30: stable; a few misses during occlusions.
  Phone 480p/30: smoother; lower CPU; gestures stayed consistent.
decisions: |
  Keep thresholds; add neutral-reset overlay prompt; implement zone-claim for players.
next_actions:
  - Add occlusion pause and toast ("show palm to rejoin").
  - Ship first microgame (Runner) with particles and screen shake.
metrics_snapshot:
  fps_median: 42
  false_fire_per_min: 0.6
  missed_fire_per_min: 1.4
notes: |
  Recognizer labels are enough for MVP; pinch analog reserved for later.
