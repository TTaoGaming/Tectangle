Focus: Why tests pass but manual Dino sidecar shows no engagement.
Signals: Facade now supports on(type,handler); e2e sets ?dino=1 auto-attach and probes; manual Launch button doesn't attach; iframe focus/autoplay nudges present only in auto path.
Decisions queued: Add FEATURE_SIDECAR_DINO_LAUNCH_ATTACH and attach on Launch; keep fail-fast e2e guard; document manual URL params.
Next audit: 2025-09-26
