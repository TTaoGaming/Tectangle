Focus: Fix GSOS e2e harness to open camera and target iframe under MP4 replay.
Signals: v2 MP4 tests green; GSOS timed out waiting for top-level \_\_cam/fps; GSOS opens camera in iframe via \_\_gso.openApp; wallpaper optional.
Decisions queued: Add pinch-variant; consider proxying \_\_cam at top-level if single camera.
Next audit: 2025-10-05
