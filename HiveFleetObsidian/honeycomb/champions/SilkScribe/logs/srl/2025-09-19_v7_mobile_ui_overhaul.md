Focus: Plan v7 mobile-first UI using MD3 bottom drawer with P1/P2 cards; prepare to move strips/timing into drawer.
Signals: v7 exists with drawer skeleton and FAB; v7 visual baseline passes; overlay wired but not drawn prominently; v6/v7 tests healthy.
Decisions queued: Adopt Option 1 (Bottom Sheet First), add drawer-open smoke test, move Kalman tray into drawer when enabled; keep deps at zero.
Next audit: 2025-09-20
