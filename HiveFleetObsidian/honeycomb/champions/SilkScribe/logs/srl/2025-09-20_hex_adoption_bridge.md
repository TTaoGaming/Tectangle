Focus: Anchor the adopt-first handshake (MediaPipe Tasks -> Hex SDK v7 -> IHC v13/v14) so new pinch adapters can ride without rewrites.
Signals:
- Guard scripts green: `idle.v13.golden.summary.json`, `idle.sdk.smoke.summary.json`, `enriched.v13.golden.twohands.summary.json` each report `"PASS": true` (generated 2025-09-20).
- Golden two-hand pinch JSONL refreshed (`golden.two_hands_pinch_seq.v1.*`) with telemetry counts in `September2025/TectangleHexagonal/out/`.
- Mocha unit runner still blocked by archived CJS import (`September2025/Tectangle/diagnostics/triageSeptember032025/failing-tests.txt`).
- TDD playbook captured at `docs/TDD.md`; agents must follow the Vitest/Playwright gates before UI wiring.
Decisions queued:
- Choose adapter contract for triple-check fusion (distance/velocity/joint-angle) and how to surface thresholds in Side Panel.
- Decide where to host keyboard mapping JSON + wrist quaternion editor (SDK facade vs adapters).
- Confirm which guard tier (`hex:tier:commit` vs `hex:tier:weekly`) will own Dino pinch once adapters land.
- Sequence Phase A/B/C work from the playbook before attempting Dino integration.
Next audit: 2025-09-23.
