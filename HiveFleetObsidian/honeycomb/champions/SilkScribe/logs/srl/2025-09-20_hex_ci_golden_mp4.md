Focus: Codify hexagonal boundary lint + golden master MP4 CI as PR guardrails with a strict flag.
Signals: Scripts exist for lint, unit, goldens; idle/no-lock smoke guards; need PR vs nightly tiers.
Decisions queued: PR uses tier:commit; nightly runs full visual + exports; add HEX_CI_STRICT override.
Next audit: 2025-10-01
