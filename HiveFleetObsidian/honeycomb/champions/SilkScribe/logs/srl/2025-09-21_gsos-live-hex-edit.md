Focus: Enable live, in-UI editing of selected hex modules inside GSOS with safe hot-swap.
Signals: GSOS has Cards (XState, MediaPipe, Seats, Settings) and static ESM runtime; bottom bar works; need a "Hex Editor" card with import map swap.
Decisions queued: Start with import-map + es-module-shims baseline; add Monaco+esbuild-wasm later; keep behind FEATURE_GSOS_LIVE_HEX_EDIT.
Next audit: 2025-09-28
