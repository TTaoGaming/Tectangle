Focus: Define a merge adapter that unifies labels, landmarks, predicted onsets, and optional quantization into a coherent per-seat stream.

Signals: In-repo Kalman/TOI ports; rich telemetry and seating adapters; need for provenance and ordering.

Decisions queued: Where to house quantizer (inside merge vs wrapper); default fields and src tags; reconcile policy for SelectPred vs Select.
