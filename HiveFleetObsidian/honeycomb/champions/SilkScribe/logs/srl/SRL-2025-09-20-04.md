focus: Digital Binder arcade loop (ethical gacha + gesture cards)
hypotheses:
  - Treating games/tools as binder cards plus 12h timers keeps engagement without grind.
  - Cosmetics-only economy with pity counters maintains goodwill while funding ops.
observations: |
  Shared binder model spans games, tools, rehab tracks, and fiducial overlays; aligns with existing gesture FSM + research logging stack. MediaPipe + OPO clutch already cover one-button needs. Timers and card drops can live client-side (PWA) to stay free + server-light.
decisions: |
  Stage rollout by tiers: start with single one-button game + free card drops, add timers/quests, then families/packs, and finally tool/learning ladders. Cosmetics stay PWYW with disclosed odds + pity; minors see direct-purchase only.
next_actions:
  - Draft JSON stubs for first 5 GameCards, 3 cosmetics, FREE_DAILY_V1 and COSMIC_SKINS_V1 packs.
  - Prototype GestureController -> Phaser scene contract with OPO FSM events.
metrics_snapshot:
  fps_median: TBD
  false_fire_per_min: TBD
  missed_fire_per_min: TBD
notes: |
  Habit loop = Daily Binder Draw (12h). Card schema + pack schema defined. Emphasize accessibility (age bands, one-button presets) and research logging (world landmarks + FSM). Economy sinks: style crafting, binder pages, avatar emotes. Compliance: COPPA/GDPR-K, pity progress shown, no dark patterns.
