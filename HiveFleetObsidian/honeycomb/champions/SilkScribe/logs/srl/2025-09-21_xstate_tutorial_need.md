Focus: Need a tutorial + analogy + metacognitive scaffolding for learning XState and state graphs, integrated with GSOS.
Signals: New GSOS windows (cards) and inspector exist; desire to adopt formal FSMs per seat with telemetry.
Decisions queued: Pick a concise tutorial path, draft a cheatsheet, and embed links/tooltips in the inspector.
Next audit: 2025-09-28
