focus: Research logging overhead
hypotheses:
  - Writing JSON at 30 Hz will add <10% CPU overhead.
observations: |
  Buffered writes (every 200ms) kept jank minimal; spikes when tab throttled.
decisions: |
  Log at 15 Hz plus on FSM transitions; rotate file every 10 minutes.
next_actions:
  - Add "Download Logs" button; anonymized session IDs.
  - Consider streaming to OPFS with background flush.
metrics_snapshot:
  fps_median: 38
  false_fire_per_min: 0.8
  missed_fire_per_min: 1.2
notes: |
  Consider newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) for big sessions.
