Focus: UI cleanup for V3 offline demo and seating adoption options.

Signals: V3 page was cluttered (Dino/Telemetry by default). Seating lacked persistence and didnâ€™t scale; handedness vs zone-x trade-offs needed.

Decisions queued: Adopt zone-x seating with hysteresis now; minimal UI mode default; keep trackers as a later layer.

Next audit: 2025-10-01
