Focus: Introduce minimal Hex registry and v2 adapter; patch HUD alignment flicker via stable cache.

Signals: Added src/hex/hexRegistry.js, src/hex/cameraV2Hex.js; HTML registers runtime; alignment cache reduces cross-contamination.

Decisions queued: Expose telemetry and settings via hex; begin keyboard mapping hex.

Next audit: 2025-10-06
