Focus: Adopt MediaPipe Tasks + tiny adapters to wire into Hex SDK, defer invention.
Signals: Repo already uses @mediapipe/tasks-vision; v7 Material demos in place; tests/guards defined (hex:tier:*). No xstate dep yet; FSM can be tiny in-house.
Decisions queued: Add InputAdapter + GateFSM + UIAdapter behind FEATURE_ADOPT_BRIDGE_V1; demo page v8; reuse existing SDK smokes as guard.
Next audit: 2025-10-04
