Abilities
- +1 - Tune the Line: Scry 2. Until your next turn, the first Adapter you create costs {1} less.
- 0 - Open a Seat: Choose Explore, Pivot, Reorient, or Exploit. Until end of turn, your first action of the chosen theme has "Draw a card, then discard a card."
- −3 - Verified: If your frozen checks passed this turn, take an extra action after this one. (Activate only once each turn.)
- −7 - Emblem - Council in Parallel: At the beginning of your end step, for each seat - if you scryed this turn, create a Scout; if you copied a spell, create an Adapter; if you found an entrypoint, create a Lesson; if frozen passed, draw a card.

Tokens
- Scout - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Scry 1."
- Lesson - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Exile this: Draw a card, then discard a card."
- Adapter - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Until end of turn, target spell or permanent you control becomes port‑compatible (rules‑light adapter metaphor)."

Flavor
"Strings taut, one cut."

Rules Notes (memetic)
- The 0 ability opens a council seat lightweight; Exploit effects should still respect your frozen gate.
- Emblem encodes distributed work (parallel seats) feeding you verified successes.
