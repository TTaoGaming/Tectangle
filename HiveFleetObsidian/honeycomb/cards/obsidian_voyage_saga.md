Chapters
- I - Map the Sea: Scry 3. You may play an additional land this turn. Create an Adapter token.
- II - Tool the Crew: Create a Scout token and a Lesson token.
- III - Cut the Seam: If your frozen checks passed this turn, choose one -
  - Resolve: Draw 2 cards, then discard a card; or
  - Launch: Create a 3/3 colorless Construct artifact creature token with
    "Whenever this deals combat damage to a player, scry 2." Then exile this Saga.

Resilience
- If a check you control failed this turn, prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to you.

Tokens
- Scout - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Scry 1."
- Lesson - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Exile this: Draw a card, then discard a card."
- Adapter - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Until end of turn, target spell or permanent you control becomes port‑compatible (rules‑light adapter metaphor)."

Flavor
"Map. Tool. Cut. Record."

Rules Notes (memetic)
- "Frozen checks passed" mirrors your CI+frozen‑smoke gate: ship only if green.
- Tokens model scouts (evidence), lessons (AAR), and adapters (ports/adapters boundary).
