Abilities
- Ward - Pay 2 life or exile a card from your hand.
- Crew 4 - Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.
- Convene - Whenever Hive Fleet Obsidian attacks or blocks, choose one -
  - Explore: Scry 2, then create a Scout token.
  - Pivot: Create an Adapter token. Until end of turn, you may change the target of up to one spell you control.
  - Reorient: Look at the top three cards of your library. You may reveal an entrypoint card (artifact, enchantment, or land) from among them and put it into your hand; put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.
  - Exploit: Ship only if frozen passed - Draw a card. You may play an additional land this turn. (You can't choose this mode unless your frozen tests passed this turn.)

Tokens
- Scout - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Scry 1."
- Adapter - colorless artifact token
  - Text: "Sacrifice this: Until end of turn, target spell or permanent you control becomes port‑compatible (rules‑light adapter metaphor)."

Flavor
"Hold the line. Cut once."

Rules Notes (memetic)
- Crew models council effort; Convene encodes once‑per‑battle council choices.
- Exploit is gated by frozen to minimize risk (no regressions).
