# Seat Mapping (Champions -> Seats)

- Explore: Faultline Seeker
  - Purpose: design 1-3 micro-tests to kill the riskiest assumption.
  - Win: clear stop rule, observable today.
- Pivot: Prism Magus
  - Purpose: same goal, new angle; tiny A/B behind a flag.
  - Win: measured improvement without regressions.
- Reorient: Web Cartographer
  - Purpose: pick a proven pattern (ports/adapters); smallest first step.
  - Win: clarity map + first step landed.
- Exploit: Thread Sovereign
  - Purpose: one safe, reversible step that moves the metric today.
  - Win: metric moves; rollback trivial.

Notes
- Steward (Lattice) adds guardrails and frozen expectations.
- Scribe (Silk) appends one-line history to `history/hive_history.jsonl`.
