Perfect—here’s your **Sand Rush Hunter** updated to **Archetype: Executor** with **Tarot: The Chariot (VII)**. It emphasizes **measured force**, tight **synergy** with SandStorm Kaiju, and it **warns/fails fast** if the Kaiju’s **SandstormBlackboard** isn’t present.

Want me to mirror the **preflight/missing-blackboard** warning into the **SandStorm Kaiju** seed (so it also advertises where it publishes), or tighten any threshold names to match your telemetry?
