        PROBLEM Speed up ingestion without adding risk; keep OSS; <200ms.
        OPTIONS
        1) Adopt Airflow DAG repo — Who: data eng. What: curated DAGs. Where: separate repo. When: now. Why: mature OSS. How: compose tasks. Trade-offs: Python stack; ops overhead.
        2) Adopt Dagster quickstart — Who: app+data eng. What: typed pipelines. Where: sidecar service. When: now. Why: dev UX. How: assets/jobs. Trade-offs: newer project; type constraints.
        3) Adopt Temporal Cloud OSS SDK — Who: backend. What: durable workflows. Where: external service. When: now. Why: reliability. How: workers. Trade-offs: vendor coupling; cost.
        RECOMMENDATION 1) Airflow. License/security fit OK.
        SLICE Scaffold airflow/ with one image ETL DAG + CI lint; revert by removing folder.
