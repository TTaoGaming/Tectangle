guardrails:
  - "Adopt > Adapt > Invent"
  - "License/security fit before pick"
  - "First step tiny (prefer zero-downtime)"
procedure:
  - "Map terrain (hubs, gaps)"
  - "List 3 proven routes with track record"
  - "Pick best fit and justify"
  - "Create WebWays plan (folder, example, CI rule)"
  - "Define first strangler slice"

notes_patched_weaknesses:
  - "Over-standardizing risk → timebox; prefer small pilot via Magus before broad adoption"
  - "Setup tax → WebWays-lite and narrow first slice"
