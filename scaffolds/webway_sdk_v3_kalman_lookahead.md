# Webway: SDK v3 â€” Kalman lookahead + TOI

Goal: Replace EMA smoothing with a simple 1D Kalman filter over normalized pinch distance to expose predictive lookahead and time-of-impact (TOI) per event.

Proven path: Constant-velocity/acceleration Kalman models for hand/pose tracking; TOI estimation from predicted threshold crossings.

Files touched: (planned) src/sdk/v3/*, appShell passthroughs, demo wiring

Markers: WEBWAY:ww-2025-004:

Next steps: Implement v3 state {x,v,(a?)}, per-frame predict/update, TOI_pred at lead window, TOI_actual post mortem; add smoke that runs MP4 and logs per-event TOI.
