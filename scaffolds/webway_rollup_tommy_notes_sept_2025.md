# Webway: September 2025 Notes Rollup

## Goal

Capture and stabilize September 2025 planning into a concise, actionable rollup at the top of `TommyNotesSeptember2025.txt`, with provenance (SRL/ADR) and a revert path.

## Constraints

- Privacy/security: keep client-side only; no external telemetry (source: defaults)
- Timebox: 20 minutes (source: defaults)
- CI: must not break tests; indices updated (source: message)

## Current Map

- Notes file exists with extensive planning, risks, and tasks. Side systems: Silk Scribe (SRL/ADR), Hex test tasks. (source: file)

## Timebox

- 20 minutes for this rollup operation. (source: defaults)

## Research Notes

- Parsed `TommyNotesSeptember2025.txt` for themes: O‑P‑O clutch, sticky FSM with predictor, wrist key‑mapping, telemetry/goldens, UI cleanup, mini‑games, guards. (source: file)
- Silk Scribe directories present (`srl/`, `adr/`, `index.*`). (source: file)

## Tool Inventory

- NPM tasks: hex:test:unit; overlay/visual/golden tasks in package scripts (source: message)
- Silk Scribe: `HiveFleetObsidian/honeycomb/champions/SilkScribe/logs/` (source: file)
- Static server tasks for local previews (source: message)

## Options (Adopt-first)

1. Baseline — Manual rollup only at top of notes (low effort, limited traceability)
   - Trade-offs: Fast but no governance trail; easy to lose changes.
2. Guarded extension — Rollup + SRL/ADR logs + index updates (chosen)
   - Trade-offs: Slight overhead; strong provenance; reversible.
3. Minimal adapter — Add script to auto-prepend rollups with template
   - Trade-offs: More setup now; repeatable in future.

## Recommendation

Option 2 for immediate traceability and CI awareness; consider Option 3 later.

## First Slice

- Prepend a timestamped rollup section and WEBWAY marker to `TommyNotesSeptember2025.txt`.
- Create SRL/ADR entries linking back here; update indices.

## Guard & Flag

- Guard: `npm run -s hex:test:unit` stays green; Silk Scribe `index.json`/`index.md` contains the new entries.
- Flag: `ROLLUP_TOMMY_NOTES_SEPT_2025` (documentation-only toggle).

## Industry Alignment

- Lightweight ADR/SRL for traceability; reversible edits; append-only logs. (source: defaults)

## Revert

- Remove the rollup header block and `WEBWAY: ww-2025-264` marker from `TommyNotesSeptember2025.txt`.
- Delete SRL/ADR files and remove their lines from indices.

## Follow-up

- TTL check by 2025-10-05; if stale, mark note done or extend.
- Consider a small script to generate future rollups from tagged sections.
