# Webway: Floating Dino Window + Seat-first labels

Goal: Provide a simple floating window for the Dino sidecar and align UI labels to seats (P1/P2) to decouple handedness.
Proven path: v5 page uses iframe + sidecar with messageâ†’KeyboardEvent bridge; draggable header for window movement.
Files touched: September2025/TectangleHexagonal/dev/demo_fullscreen_sdk_v5_material.html
Markers: WEBWAY:ww-2025-056:
Next steps: Harden focus and trust for iframe input, add optional resize handle, and unify seat mapping in SDK state.
