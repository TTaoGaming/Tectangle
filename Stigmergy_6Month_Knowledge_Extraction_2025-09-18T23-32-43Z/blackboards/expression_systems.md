# Expression Systems - Blackboard

## Focus
Drumpads, MPE channels, physics/ECS integration for musical control.

## Sources to Ingest
- [ ] (manifest) ../import_manifest.md
- [ ] metrics/doc_inventory_summary.md (scan for relevant entries)

## Active Findings
- Tectangle Project folder/ houses multiple drumpad builds (React/TypeScript, ECS, Replit variants) plus 2GB+ sample libraries (e.g., VSCO-2-CE-master.zip) supporting multi-instrument expression work.
- Hope AI toolkit (hope-ai/) defines collaboration agent personality (teaching 0.8, partnership 0.9) and memory bank taxonomy; capture in ADR-2025-09-HopeAIToolkit and reuse Polya/Conversation flow for expression agents.
- `archive-august-3-2025-physics-cleanup/archive-clean-hand-tracking/` provides reusable Three.js skeleton/FPS UI baseline; adopt status panel pattern when building Hex expression visualizer.
- `TAGS-AI-Optimized/phase1/` ships modular SimpleHandTracker/ThreeJSVisualization/WristPositionTracker components with Jest/Cypress harnesses; reuse when scaffolding Hex expression skeleton + visual debug.

## Open Questions
- _None yet_

## Next Extraction Targets
- Prioritize `Tectangle-Drumpad` and `React ECS Drumpad Tectangle` to extract reusable React MPE layers + ECS event flows for Hex expression modules.
