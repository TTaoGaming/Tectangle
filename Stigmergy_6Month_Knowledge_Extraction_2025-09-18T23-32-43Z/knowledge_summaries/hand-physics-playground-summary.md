# Hand Physics Playground Summary

## Contents
- `foundation/` (archived `.git_archived`) – large 118k-line `game.js` with audio, speech, and physics managers; baseline production playground.
- `step1-physics-*` HTML demos – physics test harnesses (basic, full, visual) used during cleanup; align with August physics cleanup docs.
- `docs/` + `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`, `README-PHYSICS.md`, `SETUP-COMPLETE.md` – document architecture, offline setup, and TODO backlog.
- `tests/` – physics regression suites complementing step1 demos.

## Key Learnings
1. **Modular Managers** – `audioManager.js` and `SpeechManager.js` encapsulate audio/speech integration; candidates for extraction into Hex utility packages.
2. **Physics Tutorials** – Step1 demos show incremental physics onboarding (basic -> visual) bridging into pinch keyboard mapping.
3. **Setup Instructions** – `SETUP-COMPLETE.md` plus offline dependencies notes ensure reproducible environment.
4. **Project TODO** – `TODO.md` lists outstanding physics playground tasks/optimizations; useful backlog reference.

## Action Hooks
- Link key managers/tests into pinch & telemetry boards for reuse.
- Reference step1 demo structure when building Hex physics regression environment.
- Maintain archived `.git_archived` folder for forensic reference.
