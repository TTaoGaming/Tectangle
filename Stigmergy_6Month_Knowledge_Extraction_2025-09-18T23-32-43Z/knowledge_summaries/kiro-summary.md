# .kiro Summary (Strategy & Steering Suite)

- Contains planning specs (`specs/`), steering notes, and releases used to prioritize cleanup of the TAGS monolith—spanning multi-hand isolation, pipeline wrappers, camera optimisation, and "Magical First 30 Seconds" onboarding strategy.
- `specs/next-steps-analysis.md` compares two MVP pushes (multi-hand vs onboarding magic) with scoring; numerous subfolders outline pipeline wrapper factory, strangler figs, etc.
- `steering/` and `releases/` (not enumerated here) support project governance milestones; treat as high-level roadmap artifacts.

**Action Hooks**
1. Reference these specs when drafting ADRs on prioritization (e.g., Option B magical onboarding) and pipeline wrapper work.
2. Link relevant spec folders to blackboards/import manifest for traceability during extraction.
