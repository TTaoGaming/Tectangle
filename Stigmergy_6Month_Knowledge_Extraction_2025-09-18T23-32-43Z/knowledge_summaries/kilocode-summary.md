# .kilocode Summary (MCP Orchestration Rules)

## Contents
- `mcp.json` – Model Context Protocol runtime configuration wiring filesystem, sequential thinking, time, memory, and puppeteer servers via `npx`/`uvx`, with allowlists for auto-approved commands.
- `rules.md` – guardrail reminder to navigate the 3MB `index-modular-monolith.html` via tag-based views instead of loading entire file.

## Key Takeaways
1. **MCP Topology** – Filesystem server points to `/Dev/`, sequential thinking and memory servers available, puppeteer automation pre-approved for navigation/screenshot/evaluate actions.
2. **Workflow Guardrail** – Explicit instruction not to stream the full monolith; rely on tag navigation to stay within context limits.
3. **Automation Hooks** – With servers declared, the hub can replicate the same AI orchestration by copying `.kilocode/` into the new environment.

## Action Hooks
- Preserve `.kilocode/` when moving the hub so MCP-enabled tooling retains server definitions.
- Incorporate guardrail note into ADR covering monolith extraction practices.

## Follow-On Tasks
- Verify the same MCP config lives in active dev environment; adjust root path if directory layout changes.
