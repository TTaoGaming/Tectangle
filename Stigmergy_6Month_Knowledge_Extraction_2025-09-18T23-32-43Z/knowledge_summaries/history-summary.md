# .history Summary (Archived Snapshots)

- Contains time-stamped snapshots of nearly every root (`.github`, `.kilocode`, Audio-Gesture-Studio, `camera-MPE-current`, etc.).
- Purpose: forensic reference only; mirrors pre-cleanup states so active mining should exclude it.

**Action Hooks**
- Keep `.history/` outside active extraction loops; document in ADR that it remains archival-only unless explicit forensic work is required.
- If space/noise becomes an issue, consider relocating `.history/` to long-term storage.
