# February 2025 Daily SRL

## 2025-02-01
- **Plan/Focus:** Stabilise late-January monolith; prep React migration.
- **What Worked:** Documented pinch heuristics and began extracting reusable UI panels.
- **What Didn’t:** Still running without version control; experiment history fragile.
- **Carry Forward:** Before refactors, snapshot decisions into ADR-Feb01-monolith-maintenance.

## 2025-02-05
- **Plan/Focus:** Spin up React/TanStack scaffold for drumpad evolution.
- **What Worked:** Created first Tailwind/TanStack layout; event loop proof-of-concept.
- **What Didn’t:** ECS concepts fuzzy; architecture notes still scattered.
- **Carry Forward:** Start ADR-Feb05-react-migration capturing target module boundaries.

## 2025-02-06
- **Plan/Focus:** Layer ECS entities onto new React shell.
- **What Worked:** Established entity-component mapping for pads and gestures; improved state isolation.
- **What Didn’t:** State explosions within monolithic files; restarts looming.
- **Carry Forward:** Commit to modular file structure & use SRL notes to track ECS assumptions.

## 2025-02-07
- **Plan/Focus:** Integrate sample packs with new ECS pipeline.
- **What Worked:** Multi-sample switching operational; audio layering improved.
- **What Didn’t:** Asset management manual; repo size ballooning.
- **Carry Forward:** Document asset strategy in ADR and move samples to dedicated storage service.

## 2025-02-08
- **Plan/Focus:** Harden ECS interactions and UI responsiveness.
- **What Worked:** Responsive layout achieved; performance improved under load.
- **What Didn’t:** CI/testing absent; manual regression heavy.
- **Carry Forward:** Introduce automated snapshots/tests; record failure cases in SRL for future agents.

## 2025-02-09
- **Plan/Focus:** Refine gesture-event mapping.
- **What Worked:** Better velocity curves; per-finger expression mapping captured in notes.
- **What Didn’t:** Config scattered; no shared schema.
- **Carry Forward:** Centralise gesture config in knowledge bank; tie to future hex telemetry.

## 2025-02-10
- **Plan/Focus:** UI/UX pass for drumpad dashboard.
- **What Worked:** Shadcn/Tailwind components improved legibility; added calibration prompts.
- **What Didn’t:** Accessibility & breakpoints still ad-hoc.
- **Carry Forward:** Compose ADR on UI guidelines; use board to track outstanding UX work.

## 2025-02-11
- **Plan/Focus:** ECS stability tests + refactor.
- **What Worked:** Decomposed some monolithic logic into reusable services.
- **What Didn’t:** No telemetry yet; debugging still manual.
- **Carry Forward:** Add instrumentation early; capture plan in `telemetry_sync` board.

## 2025-02-12
- **Plan/Focus:** Split code into reusable modules; begin archival of earlier builds.
- **What Worked:** Archived stable snapshots; prepared knowledge backup structure.
- **What Didn’t:** Duplicated assets; unclear version lineage.
- **Carry Forward:** Create ADR-Feb12-knowledge-archive describing process; enforce naming conventions.

## 2025-02-18
- **Plan/Focus:** Light maintenance & documentation.
- **What Worked:** Added notes to guides, prepping for future analysis.
- **What Didn’t:** Momentum dipped; no SRL reflection recorded.
- **Carry Forward:** Even small days get SRL log to avoid gaps.

## 2025-02-23
- **Plan/Focus:** Archive early ModularDrumpad builds (backups).
- **What Worked:** Backups structured; open-source opencv bundles isolated.
- **What Didn’t:** Backups lacked metadata; recovery path unclear.
- **Carry Forward:** Add version manifest (done later) & ADR-Feb23-backup-strategy.
