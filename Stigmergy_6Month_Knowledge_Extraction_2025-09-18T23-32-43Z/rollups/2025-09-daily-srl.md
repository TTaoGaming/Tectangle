# September 2025 Daily SRL

## 2025-09-17
- **Plan/Focus:** Stand up Stigmergy hub; audit archives; build analytics scripts.
- **What Worked:** Created metrics scripts (`loc_by_root.py`, `generate_rollup.py`, etc.), updated blackboards, reinitialised broken repos, built manifest + monthly SRL.
- **What Didn't:** `.history/` retention still undecided; ADR backlog pending.
- **Carry Forward:** Continue daily SRL going forward; finish ADRs + .history decision.

## 2025-09-18
- **Plan/Focus:** Move the Stigmergy hub into Spatial Anchor MPE, confirm knowledge assets survived the hop, and prep SRL layers for ongoing use.
- **What Worked:** Verified manifest/blackboards after relocation, sanity-checked metrics + rollup scripts in their new path, captured migration notes for SRL continuity, minted a root extraction checklist now housed inside the Stigmergy hub, mined `archive/` for TAGS modularization knowledge (module priority shortlist, pipeline wrapper strategy, strangler migration cadence), captured Hope AI collaboration toolkit DNA (personality, tool orchestration, memory taxonomy), summarized August Tectangle sprint roadmap + pinch telemetry contract, extracted the August 3 physics cleanup root (offline dependency loader, Jest test upgrade, pinch physics playground), mined TAGS-AI-Optimized for phased roadmap + Phase1 testing toolkit, catalogued the working TAGS modular monolith (production pipeline, diagnostic harness, bridge utilities), and recorded `.kilocode/` MCP orchestration guardrails.
- **What Didn't:** Haven't rerun automation scripts yet; ADR backlog still untouched; telemetry/test enablement still pending; nested `.git` archives now renamed to keep git tooling quiet; archive/hope-ai/August sprint/physics cleanup/TAGS-AI-Optimized/worked monolith action items staged in summaries but ADRs still pending beyond initial blackboard notes.
- **Carry Forward:** Run `python scripts/generate_rollup.py --git` from the new repo root, backfill ADRs for September hub setup, work through the root checklist (git fixes done via `.git_archived` renames), map archive/hope-ai/August sprint/physics cleanup/TAGS-AI-Optimized/working monolith/.kilocode/mvp/config/loose-file insights into subsystem blackboards + ADRs, and queue pinch stability extraction run.
