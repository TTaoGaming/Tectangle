# March 2025 Daily SRL

## 2025-03-26
- **Plan/Focus:** Begin cleaning ModularDrumpad backup set (`04012025/ModularDrumpad`).
- **What Worked:** Located key OpenCV/Tensor scripts worth preserving.
- **What Didn’t:** Backups lacked README/ADR context.
- **Carry Forward:** Annotate backups with manifest + ADR-Mar26-backup-review.

## 2025-03-27
- **Plan/Focus:** Continue cataloguing modular tabs & UI components.
- **What Worked:** Identified reusable UI tabs (MarkerMeasure etc.).
- **What Didn’t:** Still no central documentation.
- **Carry Forward:** Feed findings into `expression_systems` board.

## 2025-03-28
- **Plan/Focus:** Inspect audio chain & config backups.
- **What Worked:** Extracted config styles and audio mapping logic.
- **What Didn’t:** Timestamps confusing; overlapping versions.
- **Carry Forward:** Tag each backup with commit intent in manifest.

## 2025-03-29
- **Plan/Focus:** Verify modular pipeline scripts.
- **What Worked:** Confirmed pipeline modules compile.
- **What Didn’t:** Dependencies not recorded; build recipes missing.
- **Carry Forward:** Document build steps in SRL + future ADR for reproducible builds.

## 2025-03-30
- **Plan/Focus:** Consolidate high-value modules.
- **What Worked:** Isolated core tabs for measurement & calibration.
- **What Didn’t:** Duplicates remain; version confusion persists.
- **Carry Forward:** Map duplicates to single source, reference in manifest.

## 2025-03-31
- **Plan/Focus:** Close out March with knowledge capture.
- **What Worked:** Logged lessons into knowledge backup docs.
- **What Didn’t:** Still no git history; lessons could drift.
- **Carry Forward:** Begin monthly SRL retro (this doc) & plan April Replit migration.
