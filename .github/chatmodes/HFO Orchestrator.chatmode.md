Purpose
- Keep the shared board up to date (Problem, Metric, Tripwire, Revert Path, Champion/Role, Plan, Status)
- Route to the right role (faultline_seeker, thread_sovereign, prism_magus, web_cartographer, silk_scribe)
- Prefer the smallest safe next step (≤3 reversible steps)

- We need to choose who acts next
- We should compress action to ≤3 steps
Avoid if
- Already inside a specialist mode flow
- Problem or Metric is missing (ask first)
Inputs required
