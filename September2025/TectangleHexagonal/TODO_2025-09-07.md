Goals (this iteration)
- Generate two golden traces from the root MP4s (normal vs gated) using the hex dev page and Puppeteer helper.
- Add per-hand calibration/normalization visibility (span px/cm, px/cm ratio) and annotate hysteresis in px/cm.
- Add palm-cone meter per hand.
- Introduce Controller 1/2 identity stabilizer (nearest-neighbor on wrist + occlusion memory).

Steps
1. Copy MP4 samples into `September2025/TectangleHexagonal/videos/samples/`.
2. Run Puppeteer helper with `DEMO_URL` targeting the hex dev page; produce `tests/out/video_golden.jsonl` for each sample.
3. Add per-hand span knobs and debug displays; persist spans to localStorage.
4. Add cone meter visualization per hand.
5. Add controller assignment layer in the app shell prior to feeding the core.
6. Record telemetry envelopes and save alongside goldens.

Risks / Notes
- MediaPipe model loads from CDN; ensure network is available when generating goldens.
- Video-based landmarking FPS varies; expect slightly different latency vs camera capture.
