# TODO — 2025-09-18

- [ ] Enable FEATURE_PINCH_LOOKAHEAD_V1 and expose a small control panel in demo v2 to tweak lookaheadMs, leadMs (allow negative), smoothAlpha, maxAccel.
- [ ] Add e2e that plays golden pinch/idle MP4s and asserts prediction fields exist when gated, and counts expected pinch:confirm events.
- [ ] Add calibration capture (per hand): record joint-angle baselines and bone-length ratios normalized by palm width; persist to JSON and load at runtime.
- [ ] Use calibration to adjust axis under bend (de-skew) and validate reduced variance in norm at equivalent poses.
- [ ] Collect metrics on early/on-time/late confirmations vs. lookahead/lead; produce a small CSV and plot.

- [x] WEBWAY: ww-2025-008 note (TTL 21d; guard: e2e sidecar summary; flag FEATURE_SIDECAR_DINO)
- [x] Dino sidecar adapter (Digit1 emulator) with predictive vs actual TOI and session EMA bias
- [x] Wire sidecar into v3 demo behind FEATURE_SIDECAR_DINO; add URL params (?autostart=1&kalman=1&dino=1&clip=...)
- [x] Add e2e: v3_kalman_sidecar_dino.test.js to run golden MP4 and write summary
- [ ] Run MP4 between stages and tune: report downs/ups, TOI error mean/p95/max, jitter; iterate Q/R/LA and bias
- [ ] Promote Kalman TOI in runtime behind FEATURE_SDK_V3_KALMAN_TOI; emit toiPredAbsK to events/snapshots
- [ ] Session calibration store: per-seat EMA(actual − predicted); reset on seat/context change; expose via telemetry
- [ ] Add TOI replay guard: enforce mean/p95/max and jitter thresholds on golden in CI
- [ ] Dino bridge doc + README updates; ensure markdown lint

Added from September notes (priority):

- [ ] Config: keyboard mapping — wrist quaternion key mapping + 4 pinches/hand; user-customizable; JSON import/export
- [ ] SDK/API v0 — define IManager + public facade (init/setKeyMap/on/exportTelemetry), plugin stubs, docs

2025-09-18T23:40Z — Progress note (WEBWAY:ww-2025-061)

- [x] Normalize E2E base URLs to env port (E2E_PORT/E2E_HOST or SITE_BASE) and switch golden clip paths to absolute to avoid 404s.
- [ ] Run headed e2e for v5 Dino tests with `$env:E2E_PORT='8091'; $env:E2E_REUSE_HTTP='1'` and verify Space echo and pinch downs now register.
- [ ] Extend normalization to smoke/golden runner scripts if covered by CI.
