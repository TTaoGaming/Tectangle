# TODO — 2025-09-13 (Plausibility slice + automation)

Shipped yesterday → today

- Unified webcam/video paths via shared MediaPipe ports.
- Added plausibility-only core (`src/core/plausibility.js`) and wired into `dev/toi_demo.html`.
- Deterministic harness passes (confirm 1/0); added `plausibility_report.mjs`.
- Renamed golden MP4s to concise scheme under `videos/` (e.g., `right_hand_baseline_idle_v1.mp4`, `right_hand_pinch_anchor_drag_left_v1.mp4`, `right_hand_zsweep_close_to_far_v1.mp4`).

Next small steps (<1 day, reversible)

- [ ] Calibrate plausibility (vEps/vMax/aMax) on both MP4s; log histograms.
- [ ] Unit tests for `createPlausibility` (towards/away/noise) and palm gate.
- [ ] Telemetry: add plausibleFrames, plausibleRate; expose in `window.__getTelemetry()`.
- [ ] Webcam parity check: verify hands + tube overlay; fix draw path if needed.
- [ ] Non-deterministic smoke: streaming video with play/metadata timeouts.
- [ ] Baselines: run each `videos/*v1.mp4` through `dev/index.html` automation to emit JSONL (golden, landmarks, telemetry); store in `September2025/TectangleHexagonal/out/`.

Phase 0 — Pinch plausibility (replace TOI for now)

- [ ] Use plausibility as pre-gate for pinch core; count transitions when plausible sustained N frames.
- [ ] Keep TOI predictors off; reintroduce later with calibrated velocity.

CI gates (lightweight, reversible)

- [ ] Deterministic MP4s: pinch has confirm>0; gated has confirm==0; plausibility true at least once vs false.
- [ ] Optional streaming smoke doesn’t block CI.

Notes

- Keep adapters thin; ports own DOM/IO; core stays pure.
- Prefer IMAGE mode (frame-by-frame) for CI determinism; VIDEO for UX.
  
Progress — 2025-09-13

- MP4 set curated and renamed for clarity (baseline, track, Z sweep, chords, anchor-drag, occlusion, two-hands).
- Next: baseline collection via `tests/smoke/run_video_collect_golden.js` against `dev/index.html` for each clip; verify filenames align with telemetry summaries (frames, tipRange, pinch/anchor phases).
