Nice — love how clear your goal is. Below is a concise, plain-language summary of your **4-state pinch FSM** plus practical, production-grade workflows you can start following today to avoid regressions and stop the rebuild loop.

# Plain-language summary — 4-state pinch FSM (what it *feels* like)

Your gesture control uses four simple states for each finger channel:

1. **Open**
   Nothing touching. The system is watching.

2. **Possible Pinch**
   The thumb and finger are getting close. This is an intentional “maybe” window where you:

   * start counting a short hold,
   * compute **time-to-impact (TOI)** and optionally apply **music quantization** parameters (BPM, swing, look-ahead, strength),
   * show lightweight UI feedback (ghost cursor or small haptic/visual cue) so the user knows the system is sensing intent.

3. **Pinch**
   The system decided this is a real pinch (debounced). This triggers the initial `keyDown`/note event and continues to monitor the hold timer. If the hold reaches your configured threshold (e.g., 300 ms), the system will create a spatial anchor.

4. **Anchored**
   The pinch has become a spatial anchor: the finger now controls continuous parameters (2D joystick in the anchored frame, radial menu selection, MPE expression channels per finger, etc.). Release returns the FSM to **Open** (or to **Possible Pinch** briefly if re-contact is detected).

Key behaviours built into the FSM:

* **Hysteresis / two thresholds**: prevents rapid flip-flop between states.
* **Palm gating**: only allow transitions when palm is facing the camera (reduces false positives).
* **Look-ahead / TOI + quantization**: when the finger is in Possible Pinch, compute short-term motion and optionally quantize trigger timing to a musical grid or user preferences.
* **Wrist orientation layers**: wrist quaternion selects different key maps (many keys), while each finger acts as its own MPE channel in Anchored mode.

# What the user experiences

* Move finger → system shows “possible” cue.
* Hold a little longer → pinch fires (immediate event).
* Hold longer (300 ms) → anchor locks and finger becomes a joystick/expressive controller.
* Release → note off / anchor removed.

# Workflows that prevent regressions (three practical options)

## 1) Fast solo workflow — iterate quickly, stay safe

Use this when you’re experimenting or adding one feature at a time.

Steps:

1. Create a feature branch.
2. **Write one focused unit test** for the math/logic you’ll change (e.g., threshold/hysteresis or TOI calculation).
3. Implement the change in a small module (FSM, filter, or mapper). Keep the change <200 LOC.
4. Run local unit tests + run your **golden replay** test (replay a recorded landmark sequence and assert expected outputs).
5. Push → open PR. Run CI (unit tests + replay). If green, merge.
6. Run a short manual session on target device and record that session if it’s an improvement (add to golden set).

Why this prevents regressions:

* Small, testable changes and a replay harness catch logic and timing breaks quickly.

---

## 2) Robust industry workflow — for stable releases & multiple users

Use this when you want reliability, continuous delivery, and multiple testers.

Steps:

1. Protected `main` branch; all work goes through PRs.
2. Feature branches + small PRs (code review required).
3. CI pipeline runs: lint/typecheck, unit tests, deterministic integration tests against the golden dataset, basic performance smoke tests.
4. Use **feature flags** for risky algorithm changes (new predictor, different smoothing). Toggle on a small canary group.
5. Canary release → collect telemetry (false-trigger rate, latency, frame drops, FSM flip counts).
6. If metrics are good, promote to general release. If not, roll back by disabling flag or reverting the PR.
7. Maintain a **regression monitor** job: each nightly run replays golden sequences and checks for behavioral diffs (fail the build on unexpected changes).

Why this prevents regressions:

* Automated gating, staged rollouts, and objective telemetry reduce surprises and stop broken code reaching users.

---

## 3) Field-deploy / rural-first workflow — for low-resource environments

Design for offline, battery conservation, and easy hands-on updates.

Steps:

1. Build an **offline first** app (PWA or local web app) with all ML and OCR running locally.
2. Ship a minimal “safe mode” (index-pinch only + big hysteresis) that runs at lower FPS and still works reliably.
3. Use pre-bundled models and local data stores; avoid cloud dependencies.
4. Provide USB/SD install package for updates and an optional local canary group (distribute to a few devices).
5. Include a simple calibration flow (knuckle span, palm gate) and an “export logs” function so testers can give you golden recordings for improvements.
6. Keep UI simple and resilient; show immediate visual feedback for Possible Pinch, Pinch and Anchored states.

Why this prevents regressions:

* Offline deterministic behavior + easy field telemetry lets you safely iterate without breaking remote users.

# Concrete testing and anti-regression tactics (must-do list)

* **Golden replay tests**: save real landmark traces (good + edge cases). Every commit runs these and compares outputs (events + anchor times).
* **Unit tests for math & FSM**: test thresholds, timers, hysteresis, TOI/quantization behavior deterministically.
* **Deterministic integration tests**: feed recorded frames and assert event timelines (e.g., pinch at t=120ms, anchored at t=420ms).
* **Performance budget tests**: target device baseline (e.g., median inference + processing ≤ X ms). Fail builds if exceeded.
* **Telemetry counters**: false-trigger rate, anchor jitter, frame drop rate, average pipeline latency. Set thresholds and alerts.
* **Pre-commit & CI**: linters, type checks, tests. Protect `main`.
* **Small PRs + code reviews**: limit scope to reduce risk.
* **Feature flags for risky algorithms**: test in canary groups first.
* **Record-and-replay harness**: mandatory. If AI or refactor changes behavior, replay will reveal diffs immediately.
* **Manual validation checklist** for each release (one-hour hands-on session on target devices covering common gestures).

---

# Operational guardrails (how to make the team/you follow it)

* Make golden dataset part of the repo (or accessible artifact store).
* Make replay test mandatory in CI and fail merges on behavioral diffs (not just unit tests).
* Keep a changelog for model/smoothing/threshold changes (date, device, reason, before/after metrics).
* Keep PRs focused on single concern: “change TOI quantization” or “add Anchored dead-zone” — not both.
* Automate rollbacks by feature flag toggle first, code revert second.

---

# Low-effort, high-impact checklist you can start tomorrow

1. Add record-and-replay: record 10 sample gestures (good + shaky + palm-tilt + teleport).
2. Write 3 unit tests: hysteresis, TOI timer, palm-gate boolean logic.
3. Wire a CI job that runs unit tests + replay. Fail merge on differences.
4. Enforce protected main + PR reviews.
5. Start collecting telemetry (even a small CSV log) during field tests.

---

If you want, I can now:

* Convert the **“low-effort checklist”** into a one-page checklist you can stick on the wall or in your README, or
* Produce a **minimal test plan** for the golden replay sequences (what to record and what assertions to make).

Which would be most useful next?

# Gesture Input Platform — 1-Page Requirements (EARS style)

**Context / One-line:**
Camera-based, low-latency gesture input that maps multi-finger pinches to expressive MPE controls (Strike, Lift, Timbre, Pitch, Pressure) with predictive look-ahead; runs on mid-range phones/Chromebooks and supports games + musical instruments monetized via F2P cosmetics & paid instruments.

**EARS note:** Requirements below follow the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) style (simple trigger/precondition → system response). ([alistairmavin.com][1])

---

## Actors

* **User** — person using a camera-enabled device (phone/Chromebook/webcam).
* **System** — browser/web app or local app that runs hand-tracking, FSM, mapping, and output (WebMIDI / key events / local synth).
* **Field Installer / Tester** — installs offline packages, collects golden recordings.

---

## High-level goals (success metrics)

* Reliable pinch → anchor detection with hysteresis so false-trigger rate ≤ 5% in normal use.
* End-to-end input latency (camera capture → output message) under **100 ms** on target mid-range devices (optimize down to 40–60 ms).
* Deliver MVP: playable rhythm/music demo + 1 simple game within Phase 1.
* Run offline; deploy via PWA / USB for low-connectivity regions.

---

## Phases (short)

**Phase 0 — Stabilize (baseline, 1–2 wks)**
While running the app, when landmarks are captured, the system shall record landmark streams (golden traces) and support deterministic replay.
While running tests, when a replay is executed, the system shall produce the same FSM events as the recorded golden master.
Acceptance: one golden replay file in repo + CI job to run it locally.

**Phase 1 — MVP (4–6 wks)**
While user makes an index-thumb pinch and palm is gated, when Possible→Pinch transition occurs, the system shall emit a **Strike** (noteOn) and map Anchored motions to Pitch/Pressure/Timbre/aftertouch channels (WebMIDI/Tone.js demo).
While running on browser, when WebMIDI is available, the system shall expose MPE channels via WebMIDI. ([MDN Web Docs][2], [W3C][3])
Acceptance: playable rhythm demo + WebMIDI Tone.js demo.

**Phase 2 — Multi-finger MPE + TUI (8–12 wks)**
While 4 finger channels are active, when Anchored, the system shall stream per-finger continuous MPE messages (pitch bend, aftertouch, CC) and support wrist quaternion layering (50+ key maps).
While user presents a drawn paper UI, when TUI plane is detected, the system shall warp the image and OCR labels offline (cached) and map drawn zones to parameters. (Use offline OCR via Tesseract/WebAssembly). ([tesseract.projectnaptha.com][4], [GitHub][5])

**Phase 3 — Robustness & Low-resource Optimization (8–12 wks)**
While running on mid-range devices, when CPU/GPU resources are constrained, the system shall fall back to a low-FPS safe mode and preserve core index-pinch fallback behavior.
While deploying to field, when installing updates offline, the system shall support USB/SD package install and a simple calibration + log export UI.

**Phase 4 — Scale & Commercial (ongoing)**
While product has stable inputs and telemetry, when users adopt, the system shall provide SDK hooks for games and synth plugins and enable monetization flows (cosmetics store, paid instruments).

---

## Core functional requirements (EARS patterns)

**Ubiquitous**
While the app is running, the system shall normalize distances by user knuckle span for all gestures.

**Event-driven**
When thumb–finger distance drops below `T_enter` and palmFacing==true, the system shall transition to *Possible Pinch* and start TOI/quantization logic.
When *Possible Pinch* persists and `HOLD_MS` elapses (e.g., 300 ms), the system shall create a spatial anchor and enter *Anchored*.
When anchor exists and finger moves, the system shall emit continuous MPE messages mapped from anchor-relative vectors (pitch, timbre, pressure).

**State-driven**
While in *Anchored*, if palmFacing becomes false or pinch distance > `T_exit`, the system shall release the anchor, emit **Lift**, and return to *Open*.

**Unwanted behavior**
If a wrist teleport (distance jump > MAX\_TELEPORT) is detected, the system shall ignore that frame for FSM transitions and log an event for replay analysis.

**Optional / Enhancement**
If WebGPU/WASM is available, the system may run heavier predictors (Kalman / learned short-term model) to improve look-ahead accuracy.

---

## Non-functional requirements

* Hand tracking shall use a mobile-optimized pipeline (e.g., MediaPipe Hands) for on-device speed. ([mediapipe.readthedocs.io][6], [Google Research][7])
* Smoothing shall include a 1-Euro filter for low-lag, low-jitter behavior. ([Géry Casiez][8])
* OCR shall use a WASM/JS OCR engine (Tesseract.js / tesseract-wasm) and cache results to avoid repeated heavy processing. ([tesseract.projectnaptha.com][4], [GitHub][9])

---

## Acceptance criteria (per phase)

* **Phase 0:** replay harness present + 5 golden sequences (good/shaky/palm-tilt/teleport/long-hold). CI passes replay check.
* **Phase 1:** index pinch demo with explicit Strike, Anchored continuous control, and WebMIDI output works end-to-end on target device.
* **Phase 2:** 4-finger MPE streams + TUI OCR mapping tested offline; false-trigger rate ≤ 5% on sample sessions.
* **Phase 3:** app boots in offline mode; low-FPS fallback preserves index-pinch fallback behavior; logs exportable.
* **Phase 4:** SDK + basic monetization flow implemented.

---

## Risks & mitigations

* **High variance on commodity cameras** → mitigate with knuckle normalization, palm gating, and golden replay tuning.
* **Performance on low-end hardware** → mitigate with low-FPS mode, ROI cropping, and WASM/WebGPU acceleration path.
* **AI-driven code drift** → mitigate via staged changes, golden replay tests, and a “single-module change” rule for AI edits.
