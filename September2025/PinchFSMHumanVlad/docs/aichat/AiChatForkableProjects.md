## My Recommendation for **Immediate Monetization**

If your priority is to make money fast, pick something:

* **Simple to play** (low learning curve, quick fun)
* **Local multiplayer friendly** (so people demo it at parties / stream)
* **Easy to reskin and monetize** (skins, maps, themes, events)

That means your **best bets are:**

1. **SuperTuxKart** ‚Äì Racing games are evergreen, tons of room for skins/cosmetics.
2. **DynaDungeons** ‚Äì Bomberman-style = perfect gesture control, super fast fun, cosmetic bombs/avatars.
3. **Hedgewars** ‚Äì Already on mobile, highly reskinnable, party-friendly.
4. **StepMania** ‚Äì Rhythm packs = direct monetization model.
5. **Teeworlds** ‚Äì Online/local retro shooter, very sticky and fun with skins/events.

---

üëâ If you want to **start making money immediately**, I‚Äôd suggest **DynaDungeons (Bomberman clone)** as your **first release**:

* It‚Äôs Godot-based (easy to deploy on web + mobile).
* Very simple gesture mapping (move + bomb).
* Easy to reskin (skins, bombs, arenas).
* Great for local multiplayer (two hands = two players).
* You can monetize seasonal themes (Halloween bombs, Christmas maps, etc.) without being predatory.

That‚Äôs your quickest win.

Would you like me to **make a roadmap** for how to take *DynaDungeons* (or whichever you pick) from fork ‚Üí gesture integration ‚Üí reskin ‚Üí launch ‚Üí monetization within \~30‚Äì60 days? That way you‚Äôd have a practical step-by-step guide.
