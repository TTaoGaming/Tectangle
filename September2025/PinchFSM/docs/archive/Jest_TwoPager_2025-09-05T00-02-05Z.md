Page 1 — What/Why
------------------

- Jest provides assertions, mocks, snapshots, coverage, watch, and jsdom in one tool.
- Pros: easy setup, strong community, good TypeScript support.
- Cons: more heavyweight than Mocha for minimal stacks; snapshots can be brittle.
- Fit here: FSM unit tests, config schema tests, deterministic replay assertions for video‑goldens.

Page 2 — How it applies here
----------------------------

- Use cases: hysteresis/threshold transitions; debounce; dP/dt velocity mapping; event‑timeline comparisons.
- Contract: inputs = traces/config; outputs = events; expect equality on type/time/velocity within tolerance.
- Setup: add jest (+ ts‑jest if TS); configure ESM if needed; npm scripts: test, test:watch, coverage.
- Next steps: write 3 tests today — (1) enter → Strike (≥50ms), (2) held cadence, (3) palm gate drop → Lift; wire replay test reading locked traces.
