## Page 1 — What/Why

- Jest is a batteries‑included JS/TS test runner by Meta: assertions, mocks, snapshots, coverage, watch mode.
- Pros: easy setup, great DX, built‑in mocks; widely used; jest‑environment‑jsdom for DOM.
- Cons: heavier than Mocha for minimal setups; snapshots can be brittle if overused.
- Fit: FSM math/threshold tests, event timeline assertions, config schema tests, and fast CI gating.

## Page 2 — How it applies here

- Use cases: unit tests for hysteresis/debounce; golden event timelines; deterministic replay tests (pure functions).
- Minimal contract:
  - Inputs: arrays of P(t) and timestamps; config; expected events.
  - Outputs: pass/fail with coverage.
- Tooling: ts‑jest if TS; or Babel/ESM config for JS; jest.setup for shared helpers.
- Quick choice rule: pick Jest if you want snapshots and minimal config; otherwise Mocha if you prefer composability.
- Next step: add 3 tests — enter/pinch, held timing, lift on palm gate drop.
