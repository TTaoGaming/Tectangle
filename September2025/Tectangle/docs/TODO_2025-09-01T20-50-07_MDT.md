Summary  
Focus for today: build a minimal, fast, monetizable gesture game prototype (pinch-based) while mapping a phased rollout for managers and features. Keep core systems deterministic and testable with JSONL golden traces.

Today's Top Objectives (priority order)
- [ ] Create a working pinch detection prototype (distance+hysteresis) that maps thumb↔index,middle,ring,pinky to numbers 1–4.
- [ ] Add a minimal 3D visualization layer (Three.js) to show fingertip spheres, predicted ray, and confirmed contact marker.
- [ ] Wire telemetry counters for pinch and predictive TOI (`telemetry.pinch.count`, `telemetry.predictive.toi.estimate.ms.mean`).
- [ ] Build a very small playable demo: Pinch Piano (map index→thumb=1 etc), collect basic UX feedback.
- [ ] Create a feature branch and commit initial prototype: branch naming `feat/pinch-prototype-<date>`.

Today's Tasks (concrete, 2–4 hour chunks)
1. [ ] Branch & skeleton (30–45m)
   - Create branch: git checkout -b feat/pinch-prototype-20250901
   - Add files: `src/gesture/pinchBaseline.js`, `src/visual/fingertips3D.js`, `docs/TODO_2025-09-01T20-50-07_MDT.md` (this file).
2. [ ] Pinch baseline (1–2h)
   - Implement distance + hysteresis logic (thresholds scaled by wrist→middle distance).
   - Emit events: `pinch:down`, `pinch:up`, and telemetry counters.
3. [ ] Visualize (1–2h)
   - Add Three.js layer to draw spheres and a line for predicted ray.
   - Visualize numeric label near the hand for confirmed pinch.
4. [ ] Demo glue & UX (1–2h)
   - Map pinches to number keys and play simple tones (Pinch Piano).
   - Add basic on-screen instructions and a record button to capture plays.
5. [ ] Basic golden trace & smoke test (1–2h)
   - Record a short JSONL trace of a clean pinch session and add a simple smoke test asserting `telemetry.pinch.count > 0`.

Short term (this week)
- [ ] Harden thresholds and smoothing to reduce false positives in common lighting conditions.
- [ ] Add predictive filter (Explorer) fallback for earlier detection and visualize predicted ray.
- [ ] Publish an internal APK/preview link for small A/B with friends/devs and collect metrics.

Medium term (1–3 months) — productization
- Create 3 simple gesture games (minimal monetization):
  - Pinch Piano (free, in-app tips/donate)
  - Pinch Runner (gestures to jump/slide) — basic ads + paid unlock
  - Pinch Tap Target (leaderboards + small entry fee/ads)
- Add Telemetry dashboards to measure retention/conversion for each game.
- Iterate on PredictiveLatencyManager: Explorer → KF → Rapier confirm (hybrid) per device capability.

Long term (6–12 months)
- Add hybrid Rapier confirm for high-end devices (Option 3 in AiChatTOI).
- Add optional avatar (VRM) layer for social features and expressive feedback.
- Build a small marketplace for mini-games / templates for creators.

Manager roadmap (phased per manager)
- CameraManager
  - Level 0: stable device listing & frame emission (done)
  - Level 1: metadata & dynamic reconfigure (done)
  - Level 2: add diagnostics & low-power mode
- LandmarkSmoothManager
  - Level 0: current smoothing (OneEuro)
  - Level 1: predictive smoothing integration (tune params)
  - Level 2: integrate with PredictiveLatencyManager for predictive pass-through
- PredictiveLatencyManager
  - Level 0: Explorer (constant velocity) — quick baseline
  - Level 1: KF/Analytic TOI — weekly iteration
  - Level 2: Rapier confirm (hybrid) — for high-end devices
- KinematicClampManager
  - Level 0: plausibility checks (current)
  - Level 1: consume predictive states for earlier gesture recognition
  - Level 2: optional physics-assist mode
- TelemetryManager
  - Level 0: counters + export
  - Level 1: golden trace validators + CI counters
  - Level 2: dashboards & retention funnels

Monetization quick-start (practical)
- Launch Pinch Piano as an MVP (one screen, immediate play).
  - Keep it free; add "Buy me a coffee" / small tip flow (Stripe/PayPal) and an optional 'no ads' one-time purchase.
- Add simple ads (rewarded video) to Pinch Runner for early revenue.
- Optimize store listing & short demo video; push to a small set of users for feedback.

Acceptance criteria & telemetry (short-term)
- `telemetry.pinch.count` increasing week-over-week for demo users.
- `telemetry.predictive.toi.estimate.ms.mean` decreases after adding Explorer filter.
- Golden trace smoke tests pass deterministically in CI for basic pinch traces.

Quick risks & mitigations
- Risk: false positives in noisy lighting → Mitigation: conservative thresholds + confirm via short dwell (>80ms) or prediction confidence.
- Risk: high CPU on old phones → Mitigation: offer Rapier as optional download and default to filter-only baseline.

Final actionable checklist for today
- [ ] Create branch and add file: [`September2025/Tectangle/docs/TODO_2025-09-01T20-50-07_MDT.md:1`](September2025/Tectangle/docs/TODO_2025-09-01T20-50-07_MDT.md:1)
- [ ] Implement baseline pinch detection and Three.js visualization
- [ ] Add telemetry counters and record a golden trace
- [ ] Build Pinch Piano demo and share a quick video clip

If you want, I will now:
- [ ] Create the repository skeleton files for the prototype (code stubs for pinchBaseline, fingertips3D, and telemetry hooks)
- [ ] Implement the distance+hysteresis prototype and a minimal Three.js demo (I can generate the code stubs)
