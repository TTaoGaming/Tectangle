Purpose
This GameBoard is the canonical, self-contained state/action snapshot for Hope. It is stored in the same directory as the agent definition so the two files can be moved as a pair. Keep this file lightweight â€” use Nodes to represent discrete work items, experiments, or diagnostics.

HowToUse
1. CurrentNode points to the node you are working on. Update CurrentNode as you move.
2. Add new nodes under Nodes with PascalCase keys: Id, Title, Description, Resources, Platform, Possibilities, Constraints, Goals.
3. Use the Goals map for short-term to long-term planning using PascalCase horizon keys (FiveMinutes, TenMinutes, OneHour, OneDay, OneWeek, OneMonth, OneYear, TenYears).
4. Hope will reference this file automatically and include the CurrentNode in both human-readable and JSON outputs.

SelfContainedNotes
- This file is designed to be portable with [`September2025/Tectangle/Agent.md`](September2025/Tectangle/Agent.md:1). If you move these files to another folder or repository, update any external Resource file paths inside nodes if those targets move.
- If you want to maintain a history, keep copies under a docs/archive or `.history` folder before moving.

ExampleNodeWalkthrough
- To move the CurrentNode to a new node, add the node then set CurrentNode to the new node's Id.
- For automation later, scripts can parse this file's YAML frontmatter to build context bundles for Hope.
