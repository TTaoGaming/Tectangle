SUMMARY 
# Tectangle — Executive Summary, SDK/API Outline & Prioritized To‑Do (2025‑09‑12)

## TL;DR (Gold & Logic)

* **North Star:** Camera‑only gesture → **deterministic input layer** (keyboard/MPE) that feels instant, works on mid‑range phones/Chromebooks, and generalizes to music, games, and training.
* **Near‑term win:** Rock‑solid **pinch** (4 pinches/hand) + **wrist‑quaternion key‑mapping** + **quantization** → ship Piano Genie + 2–3 mini‑games.
* **Core logic:** Triple‑redundant pinch detect with **(A) distance ratio**, **(B) velocity toward/away**, **(C) finger‑bend**; fuse as a **confidence** and drive a **sticky state machine** with **dead zones** and **predictive latency** (time‑to‑contact).
* **Architecture:** All features live in **Managers** (black boxes) with a common interface and smoke tests: Camera → Landmarks → Smooth → Physics‑plausibility → Anatomy/Rigging → Pinch → Mapper (keys/MPE) → Quantizer → UI/Telemetry.
* **Non‑negotiables:** Deterministic slider values, telemetry‑first, palm‑facing‑camera starter mode, geofenced dead‑zones, hand ID tracking (no overlapping ghost hands), reversible feature flags.

---

## How the Current Pinch System Works (Plain Language)

**Inputs:** 21 hand landmarks/frame + derived wrist quaternion + per‑joint angles + fingertip velocities.

**Detectors (redundant):**

1. **Distance ratio** — normalize thumb↔finger distance by **knuckle span** (z‑invariant). Hysteresis uses two ratios: **enter** (tighter) vs **exit** (looser) to avoid flicker.
2. **Velocity gate** — require **closing velocity** (toward) to **trigger**, **opening velocity** (away) to **release**; same‑direction as hand travel ⇒ ignore.
3. **Finger‑bend** — verify joint‑angle change consistent with a real pinch (no straight fingers = no intent).

**Fusion:** Each detector yields **confidence**; combine (weighted vote) → **Armed → Triggered → Held → Released** state machine (with minimal dwell times). Optional **look‑ahead** predicts **time‑to‑contact (TtC)** to fire earlier for “negative‑latency feel,” then self‑correct at contact.

---

## Gaps & Risks

* **Lag** from heavy smoothing (EMA/3‑buffer). Tuning + look‑ahead needed.
* **HUD bugs** (floating/side panel); duplicate legacy UI from 3D playground.
* **Hand ID ghosting** (both hands mapped to one physical hand) and **same‑space overlap**.
* **Telemetry friction** (two buttons, scattered stats).
* **Coordinate/viewport misalignment** from the new CameraManager.

---

## 3 High‑leverage Improvements

1. **Predict‑then‑verify**: Add a tiny (e.g., 60–90 ms) look‑ahead using closing velocity + acceleration → fire with **TtC threshold**; confirm at contact; auto‑bias by BPM/quantization.
2. **Confidence fusion v2**: Calibrated weights per detector by scenario (occlusion, low‑light). Export per‑event confidences + reasons to telemetry for data‑driven tuning.
3. **Sticky FSM + geo‑fences**: Enforce Armed/Triggered/Held/Released with dwell ms; add **dead zones** (spatial anchors, screen edges); ignore events in restricted zones.

*(Bonus)* **Hand identity resolver**: Greedy nearest‑neighbor + orientation + bone‑ratio + motion history; never allow two hands to occupy \~the exact same xyz hull.

---

## SDK / API v0 (Make it easy to extend)

**Design goals:** Deterministic, small, tree‑shakeable, web‑first.

**Core events:** `pinch:armed|trigger|hold|release`, `wrist:orientation`, `map:keyDown|keyUp`, `telemetry:snapshot`.

**TypeScript‑style interfaces (sketch):**

```ts
export type Hand = 'left' | 'right';
export type PinchId = 'thumb-index'|'thumb-middle'|'thumb-ring'|'thumb-pinky';
export type WristPose = 'north'|'south'|'east'|'west'|'tiltUp'|'tiltDown';

export interface IManager<Cfg=any, In=any, Out=any> {
  id: string; init(cfg: Cfg): Promise<void>;
  start(): void; stop(): void;
  on<E extends string>(evt: E, cb: (data:any)=>void): () => void;
  feed(input: In): void; // deterministic IO only
  getState(): Out; getConfig(): Cfg; setConfig(patch: Partial<Cfg>): void;
}

export interface KeyMapCfg {
  left:  { wrist: Record<WristPose,string>, pinch: Record<PinchId,string> };
  right: { wrist: Record<WristPose,string>, pinch: Record<PinchId,string> };
}
```

**Public API (facade):**

```ts
tectangle.init(opts);
tectangle.setKeyMap(cfg: KeyMapCfg);
tectangle.on('pinch', h=>{ /* ... */ });
tectangle.exportTelemetry();
```

**Plugin points:** `Smoother`, `PinchDetector`, `Mapper`, `Quantizer`, `Renderer`, `Recorder` all conform to `IManager`.

**Visuals:** Built‑in **Wrist Compass** overlay (tiny radial around wrist) shows current orientation + the 4 pinch lines with the **mapped key labels**.

---

## Configuration: Keyboard Mapping (Wrist + 4 Pinches/Hand)

* **Per hand**: map each **wrist pose** to a key (e.g., `north='Shift'`) and each **pinch** to keys (e.g., `thumb‑index='A'`).
* **Modes**: music (MPE/notes/CC), typing (keys), game (actions). Export/import as JSON.
* **UI**: Click wrist compass sectors + pinch lines to assign; live preview.

---

## Quantization & Smoothing (Deterministic)

* **Quantizer:** BPM, Grid (1/4…1/64, triplets), **Strength** (0–100%), **Swing**, **Humanize** ms. Applies only to **release** or **post‑fire correction**; never blocks safety.
* **Smoothing slider:** Single scale maps to fixed One‑Euro params; show ms of added latency.

---

## Telemetry & Smoke Harness

* **Smoke harness (definition):** A tiny automated **end‑to‑end check** that the critical path runs after launch/commit.
* **Harness run:** load a known 10 s clip → Camera→Landmarks→Pinch→Map→Report(JSON/CSV). Assert counts/latency bounds; fail fast with reasons.
* **Telemetry schema (per event):** ts, device, hand, pinchId, ratio, vel, accel, jointAngles, TtC, confidences{A,B,C}, state, quantizePhase, smoothingLevel, zones.
* **UI:** Single Start/Stop/Export button in Side Panel; “Pinch Stats” table & charts.

---

6. **Telemetry & harness**
   ☐ Per‑event CSV/JSONL
   ☐ Offline replay cli
   ☐ Error simulators: occlusion, noise, mirror‑hand, edge taps
7. **Camera/coord fixes**
   ☐ CameraManager logs config at start
   ☐ Viewport alignment tests; fix aspect/transform
8. **Mini‑games (for feel)**
   ☐ UFO Grabber, Kabuto Sumo, Pachinko (thin shells over input layer)

---

## Visuals & UX Notes

* **Wrist Compass overlay** (recognizable instantly)
* **Pinch Lines** (4 per hand) with live key labels
* **Palm‑forward starter mode**; later allow more poses
* **Screen/pivot dead zones** tags shown faintly
* **All tunables visible** (knuckle span, wrist quat, bone chain)

---

## Manager List (v0) & Order

Camera → Landmark → Smoother → **PhysicsPlausibility** → **Anatomy/Rigging** (Kalidokit/VRM) → PinchDetector → Mapper (keys/MPE) → Quantizer → UI → Telemetry.

**Rule:** Smooth → Physics plausibility → Anatomy; then higher‑level logic. Treat each as a black box with deterministic IO and a smoke test.

---

## Definitions (1‑liners)

* **Hysteresis:** Different enter/exit thresholds to avoid flicker.
* **One‑Euro filter:** Simple adaptive smoothing with tunable cutoff; balances latency vs jitter.
* **Time‑to‑Contact:** Predicted time until collision, from distance/velocity/accel.
* **Smoke test/harness:** Minimal end‑to‑end test proving the system “basically works” after changes.

---

## What to Ship First (Reversible, High‑Confidence)

1. Side Panel (single telemetry control + Pinch Stats).
2. Wrist Compass + key‑mapping editor.
3. Sticky FSM + confidence fusion + TtC.
4. UFO Grabber demo + Piano Genie quantized mode.

*This doc is intentionally concise so it prints to \~2 pages. Ask for the TypeScript skeletons (interfaces, facade, telemetry schema) when ready to cut.*

-------------------------











can you help me add to my todo list. 1 a config option for keyboard mapping so wrist quaternion key mapping + 4 pinch per hand. 2, help me create sdk and api for this app. so it's easy to work with and adapt for different uses. 

get 4 pinches well
then add in wrist quaternions for keymappings
user customizable
need some kind of good visual representation for users


pinch detection improvement
velocity release
so velocity confirmation for trigger/strike and releae/lift

I want to understand how my code works better So what I want your help with is to document and help me understand my current pinch system I think I have a knuckle ham palm breath ratio as the hysteresis with velocity as a double checker i'm thinking about using joint angles as a triple check so if the users fingers do not bend then we can assume the user didn't try to pinch right The idea is to create multiple redundant systems to get really good pinch detection in multiple different formats and then have them cross reference and make sure they're working together I think the math should be very simple so we shouldn't be having a lot of performance issues but I want you to help me understand how my current system works and then give me three suggestions of how we can really improve it to get it to be more reliable especially on our offline mid range smart phone or Chromebook

need to remove floating hud there are errors there. the debug panel does seem to be working
what's important is pinch statistics

dead zones
around spaial anchor
also around screen edges
 use telemetry on hands occupying the same space
 mis clicks/pinches that are wrong
 we want to simulate the errors and have a plan for each and every one of them
 we're have something truly robust
 but we phase it so we don't get caught up and dragged into the details

 make sure the sidepanel is working correctly cause it is not yet
 move telemetry recording button to be just 1, start/stop and export instead of 2 and put it into the sidepanel 

 clean up the ui buttons and stuff there are old things from the 3dplayground foundation app that is not part of tectangle

 the idea is 3 pinch redundancy systems
 absolute knuckl;e span ratio distance - z level invarianty
 velocity/acceleration finger tips - the fingers have to be moving towards each other
 finger bend - user has to bend their fingers
 3 independant systems to ci control and validate pinch wt with confidence levels to help further differentiate
 add in thermal and 3d scans later


 add in mini games
 like
 ufo grabber switch
 kabuto sumo 
 pachinko
 just copy the best games and most popular of all time


 user adjustable smoothing just 1 slide bar from more smooth to more responsive
 with deterministic numbers so 1 known value is accurate for all
 for example one euro, the scale should be deterministic

 and for the debug views we can add toggles to turn off/on like feature flags listing to events Wait for my mark relax do not think of the best man just sleep on the target Standing please I can't Oh the None Seriously I found a deer I pray with myself I'm not already sick for a long time I can do this Still can't get the doors of Alright hope that you love everyone I faced would finally make you feel something yes I can't hear it Finally after all of the starving what do I do My son is not ready to kill your ashes to the top mountain people And neither of them are I do not know how to do this without you But we cannot stay here boy there was so much I thought You're all right Got to call right Come I'll leave it we're leaving now Thought I wasn't ready for that we have no choice now Yes Sir Mountain It's going to be a long trip yes but an important one Oh what this happened Good time. the idea is to have the bottom panel look good and hold everything and be user configurable. but it needs to look minimalistic and nice. 

 screen dead deadzone for pinch detection


 multiple hands can't start together but they can meet up and link for later
 for now keep palms away from each other, finger can touch

 map media pipeline to standard rigging sdk or standards 
 easy to change models later


 trigger and release acceleration and velocity filter kinematic clamps

 need visuals for wrist quaternions and keymappings somehow
 needs something the user can recognize instantly


 add in a quantization module and make it user adjustablewith bpm, quantize strength, grid/snap, humanize and swing and other options for good quantization


 clean up the media pipeline 21 landmark logic layer
 fabrik/ik model?
 absolute measuredSpan_umaybe limit it to palm facing camera
 pinch hysteris with absolute rules
 acceleration and velocity check for pinch
 joint angle change for pinch
 have it all be confidence based
 multi high confidence = trigger
 use lookahead

 hand wrist headzone to stop multi hand appearing on 1 real hand
 the mapping logic


 1 game game dev studio
 my gesture to input system is an input layer device.

 constrain user to palm towards camera for start
 remove alot of the flickering and other issues


 need every setting visual that is toggleable
 like knuckle span
 wrist quaternion
 finger bone chain 


 visual - remove the background and make it almost full screen. piano genie 

 limit users to just palm towards camera for pinch mode

 use ai
 feed it nasa and v model software engineering prinicples
 what would make sense for precision pinch with look ahead window for predictive latency
 I was thinking knuckle span absolute ruler + acceleration gating (towards for trigger away for release, same direction = hand movement not releasing of pinch)
 +joint angle verification
 +thermal/3d camera data later
 +confidence levels and we can do a consensus model or if one of the confidence is low it can default to uncertainty

 use kalido kit media pipeline to rigging api to VRM 
 interchangable vr models for rigging

 big problem 1 hand video showing left and right hand both on the same real hand and occupying the same 3d space, that is just wrong
 I want hands to be able to be close to each other, let finger tips touch like right hand thumb to left hand index later but there is no way 2 hands occupy the exact same position and space
 this is a logic and filtering issue I think
 I want hands to be able to be close to each other, let finger tips touch like right hand thumb to left hand index later but there is no way 2 hands occupy the exact same position and space
 this is a logic and filtering issue I think

 teach me about smoke harness. twhat is this kind of testing called. how can I maximize this? what can I do

 we need to do sticky state. which is why I wanted distance and velocity gating for trigger and also for release and we should do outlier gating. the main idea and the main problem I want you to help me solve is solve mediapipeline input. 

 I changed the camera input to be my camera manager, can you first make sure it console logs on start up with settings and values. I want to start the app copy and paste the console to you for review. because i think the camera manager is causing some problems with alignment. the visuals don't seem to aligned correctly anymore, there might be coordinate/screen size issues. 

 I need you to check my system for me specifically I think that there used to be an old camera app the idea right now is to start moving everything into individual managers which are acting almost like module interfaces with specific responsibilities it's helping me mentally map this a lot easier so I'm trying to do a manager model So I think one of the main baselines is camera manager which is passing the frames and then we'll just create each manager at a time i'm going to go and give you my summary document I need your help to sort of move this step by step Recently I was doing some changes to that pinch detection and I think we added in a 3 big buffer with EMA filtering and I think that's introducing a huge amount of lag into my system because right now my pinches are barely even registering It's taking multiple seconds to register I think this can be solved through a combination of things one is changing the tuning of course but 2 is also to really work in the look ahead window so that we can do velocity look ahead and a time to contact so that we can get really precise and really reliable pinch detection with essentially predictive latency

 i need your help in updating my overall vision for the app. please read the attached documents to get a general picture.
 what I want you to note is different levels of abstraction. My highest vision goal is to solve resource scarcity for training equiptment for humany, not by Mimicking form but instead fulfilling function O using a combination of hand tracking and tangible user interfaces with feedback mechanisms That's the overarching goal right To solve one of humanity's fundamental problems or at least create a path towards it even if I can't do it in my lifetime My strategic goal is to make income and create a business using AI coding agents and essentially an army of AI agents and expert modes too Use my gesture input to synthetic keyboard layer to essentially create all kinds of apps from medical cadaver studies using integrations with drones and projectors So just games like Flappy Bird you know different things I can do right because this is an input layer I can just use any software really so in the service event I really need to work on my pinch detection and make sure my coat is solid and it's ready to deploy across occasionally my tactical role is really just to get piano genie and basic pinching working well so that I can start sharing this with other people I want to get 88 key iano or at least like maybe 16 key piano to start and then just keep upping it until have multiple world records because I'm going to do spatial anchors with MPE so I think this is going to be the world's first gesture based 100 plus key M instrument that I'll have pre loaded piano that users can input any kind of south alpha where I'll have different sound libraries for them using things like the community open source projects. my current task is to get the ui decent and then just work on pinching and hand orientation it's not tuned well and there are some duplication and flaws in logic
 I have this deep pain in my soul when I hear of the difference in education and opportunity between the have and the have not in the world. the pain of parents working so hard to help their children and a lack of educational options in rural areas or maybe the education system is failing them. I want to provide the tools they need to succeed in their everyday and future life as long as they have access to a smartphone like device running camera and CV. a suite of tools to bring hope. from a full grand piano with mpe controls to rival any professional instrument available in the world, to medical study and manipulation and tutorials, to cadaver studies, to hand tracking based trainings in cpr, to tying tournaquets. I want to create medic and tutor drones that can accurately diagnos and assess and create tailored content and use projection and other tools to really engage the user. this is not a toy, it;s digitally emulating tools that will fulfill the function if not the form of real tools

 control robots, cnc machines, it's a mouse and keyboard + 3d hand gestures and spatial anchors with vector manipulation and predictive latency to get that feel of snappyness since we can do a lookahead window using physics simulations

 I want your help in creating better header and documentation within the individual files themselves So for example within the game JS file within the camera manager file within the landmark raw manager file et cetera right like ideally I would only have managers and that each individual manager file would have a top AI header with you know a TLDR and how to use this make it easy for new AI devs and human devs when they read the file to understand what this module does and how to interface with it the idea is like creating a black box for the user to use with clear Apis part of my goal is each manager should almost their own little black box that does a specific thing for me That's how I mentally imagined I don't know what the formal architecture would be called and I think we should enforce some kind of interface for all the managers that I have'cause I'm starting to build out my entire pipeline with a manager for each section of the pipeline

 The main idea is to fuzzy match noisy landmark inputs to a physical hand in 3D space so there is physical rules and laws in place and using anatomy and because of the understanding of bone structures muscle structures that we can get a much estimation and prediction of where the hand is and where the hand will be in what position using a combination of physics look ahead Musical quantization look ahead And joint Ang movement prediction bio mechanics

 documentation for the manager files in the header have it all be self contained

 i think we need to discuss the specs for this project, I think my architecture is evolving. I want to keep managers only, Come onthey are black boxes with deterministic input output that I can smoketest. we need to discuss the entire dataflow and what managers I need to replace my old system and what redundancy or consolidication can I do. I think theree Needs to be some kind of interface for managers because I don't want them to all be different kinds of managers I want them to be similar in the sense that the top should all have the AI header structure so that it's easy for AI coding associates to work with my code to have easy search terms so the AI can easily find where the a specific API and all that stuff is like I want to make my code super easy to work with and each manager is almost like a standalone little microservice that I just wire together Is that the right way to do this Please consider my idea give me a summary of my current app and my vision in a sense like especially take a look at some of my notes what I want to do is I really want to clarify the project scope and what we're really doing Sprint/foundation/docs/TECTANGLE_GAP_ANALYSIS_2025-08-25T19-03-25_MDT.md @/tommy-notes-august2025.txt

 what do you perceive and know

 See there's some flaw in the logic that we need to discuss specifically this smooth landmarks should be fed into the physics plausibility first and justice do a kinematic Santa Fe show And then physics plausibility output should feed into the anatomical anatomy So we're almost sure that these are the hand landmarks right And then the anatomy manager can actually fuzzy match to a standardized hand model rigging API like web XR or some other output I don't really care but it needs to be some kind of standardized model and what I want to do as well is to take predictive latency is going to essentially use the combination of the physics and the anatomy and the context in this case it's music so we would do quantization musical and essentially what we want is to create early time to contact prediction and the pinch recognition model is really just using the knuckle span ratio which pretty much a real world distance measure since we have data absolute ruler So what we should get actually is an pinching event that triggers as the user is bringing their hands touching and when the user's hands touch that should be almost an instantaneous feedback or even negative latency Because we have the velocity and acceleration data we can trigger anything we want as long as we have the time to contact and we can have that be user adjustable increase or decrease that window so that it feels good to
