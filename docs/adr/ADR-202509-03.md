title: V13 Freeze, V14 Spawn, Two-Hands P1/P2 Lock-In as Primary Test

Context

- We standardized the UI in V13 (Tailwind shell) while keeping the same data path as V11/V12.
- The critical acceptance scenario is a two-hands clip: Right-hand pinch followed by Left-hand pinch, which should seat-lock P1 then P2 and emit enriched telemetry every frame post-lock.
- We added Puppeteer/Jest smokes to validate this path reliably; MP4 decode tends to be more reliable headed, so we allow HEADLESS=0.

Decision

1) Freeze V13 as a stable baseline for UI shell and enriched telemetry contract (post-lock per-frame: norm/rawNorm/velocity/acceleration/palmAngleDeg/index angles).
2) Establish the two-hands clip (Right then Left) as the primary regression for seat-lock invariants; fail if both seats donâ€™t lock.
3) Spawn V14 for further research (angle velocity/jerk, predictor fusion) without breaking the V13 baseline.
4) Keep the exporter on V11 for now; use V13 smokes to ensure parity in enriched fields.

Consequences

- Test discipline: CI and local loops can run the V13 two-hands lock-in test to catch regressions in seat-lock or telemetry presence.
- Ergonomics improvements and predictors go into V14; V13 remains a known-good shell.
- If MP4 decode flakes, prefer headed mode (HEADLESS=0) or adjust jest-puppeteer settings.
