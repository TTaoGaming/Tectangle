TL;DR: Universal, accessible hand-tracking pipeline that yields a deterministic, palm/orientation-gated pinch with perceived zero latency via predictive lookahead; scales from party games to medical/tool virtualization using just a smartphone (projector/VR optional).

What we are building

- Media pipeline → smoothing/filters (no teleport) → deterministic pinch FSM (hysteresis, knuckle normalization, telemetry).
- Predictive lookahead: Kalman/time-to-contact and musical quantization to reach perceived zero latency.
- Start small: one robust pinch (party/multiplayer like Flappy Bird), then multi-hand and mapping.
- Long-term: tool virtualization and training overlays (OpenCV contours, object recognition), smartphone-first.

Policy

- NOTHING is “done” without tests/integration/3rd-party validation.
- Unverified artifacts are provisional; we freeze only after golden replay + CI.
