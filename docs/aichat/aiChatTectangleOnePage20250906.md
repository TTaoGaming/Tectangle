Awesome—DDD is a great fit for what you’re building. Here’s how I’d reshape your plan for **near-zero perceived latency** (piano + gaming), what to copy from proven systems, and the traps to dodge.

# One-pager: DDD plan for near-zero-latency gesture→MIDI/Game

## 1) Ubiquitous language (keep it everywhere)

* **Controller** (aggregate): a hand tracked across time with stable `controller_id`, `hand_id`.
* **Pinch** (entity): state machine with hysteresis (trigger/release), velocity gates.
* **Clock** (domain service): unified timebase (audio clock) for all scheduling.
* **TTC** (domain service): time-to-contact predictor from fingertip approach.
* **Profile** (value object): per-user filter params, beat-phase offset, knuckle-span cm & ratio.

## 2) Bounded contexts (map to threads/workers)

* **Sensing** (Port/Adapter): frames→21-landmarks (+ handedness/world coords). Use MediaPipe Hands or the new Hand Landmarker. ([Google AI for Developers][1])
* **Tracking** (Domain): smoothing (One-Euro/Kalman), plausibility checks, **ID assignment** via greedy/Hungarian on 3D distance + motion continuity + wrist pose prior; short re-ID window. (Hungarian = standard minimal-cost assignment.) ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Gesture** (Domain): Pinch FSM → events (Anchored, Hold, Release).
* **Timing** (Domain): **Clock + TTC + Quantizer** (snap to grid for music / frame budget for games).
* **Emission** (Port/Adapter): keyboard events, WebMIDI/MPE. Web MIDI is supported (user permission prompt applies). ([Chrome for Developers][3])
* **Calibration** (Domain): beat-pinch phase fit; knuckle-span normalization; auto-tune filter params.
* **Observability**: telemetry stream (landmarks, TTC, FSM, IDs) for golden-master diffs.

**Why this shape?** It makes **time** and **IDs** first-class domain concepts, isolates noisy I/O at the edges, and lets you test/replay each context independently.

## 3) Real-time path (what actually makes it feel instant)

* Run **audio-adjacent scheduling** in an **AudioWorklet** (separate audio thread) with `AudioContext({ latencyHint: 'interactive' })`; read `audioContext.baseLatency` to verify budget. AudioWorklet exists for low-latency processing off the main thread. ([MDN Web Docs][4])
* Target musician-grade latency (single-digit ms to \~10–15 ms end-to-end); perceptual studies show small differences \~10 ms are noticeable to musicians—hence beat-phase correction + TTC prediction. ([ACM Digital Library][5])
* Use **One-Euro** for jitter vs. lag trade-off (simple to tune, proven in interactive tracking). ([ACM Digital Library][6])
* For musical quantization and network/session sync, copy the idea behind **Ableton Link** (shared tempo/phase). Your “beat-pinch” calibration writes the phase. ([ableton.com][7])

## 4) “Distributed” without killing latency

Prefer **local-distributed hexagon**: each bounded context runs in its own **Web Worker / Worker Thread** with **versioned schemas**; the **domain** (IDs, FSM, TTC, Clock) lives in its own worker. UI only subscribes to domain events—can’t break timing. If you outgrow it, the same ports let you move a worker out-of-process later.

## 5) Golden-master strategy (anti-regression)

* **Video goldens** + **telemetry goldens** (expected FSM/ID/TTC timelines).
* CI: headless replay → assert domain events; on failure, upload side-by-side overlay.
* **Contract tests** at every port (zod/io-ts) so a missing value can’t cascade.

# What to copy (proofs & examples)

* **MediaPipe Hands / Hand Landmarker**: 21 landmarks, world coords + handedness—good baseline for the Sensing port. ([Google AI for Developers][1])
* **One-Euro filter**: widely adopted for interactive motion to balance noise and lag with two tunable params—great starting filter. ([ACM Digital Library][6])
* **AudioWorklet + interactive latency**: run scheduling on the audio thread; verify `baseLatency`; this is the web’s intended path for **very low-latency audio**. ([MDN Web Docs][8])
* **Musician latency tolerance**: plan for \~≤10 ms subjective threshold; justify beat-phase & TTC tricks to “feel” instant. ([ACM Digital Library][5])
* **Tempo/phase sync**: Ableton Link shows the value of a shared clock/phase across components—mirror this inside your Timing context. ([ableton.com][7])
* **ID stability**: standard assignment problems use Hungarian/greedy matching; applying that to controller IDs avoids swaps under occlusion. ([Wikipedia][2])

# Common failures (and how to avoid them)

1. **Main-thread everything** → jank & GC pauses break timing.
   **Fix:** Workers + AudioWorklet; no `setTimeout` for music timing—schedule from the audio thread. ([MDN Web Docs][8])

2. **UI coupled to domain** → a UI tweak breaks input timing.
   **Fix:** Ports/Adapters. UI subscribes; domain runs headless under test.

3. **No single clock** → drift between video, UI, and audio.
   **Fix:** One **Clock** service (audio time); translate all timestamps into it.

4. **Unversioned messages** → one missing field nukes the pipeline.
   **Fix:** Versioned schemas at every port; contract tests in CI.

5. **No calibration** → wrong thresholds; user feels laggy/over-triggered.
   **Fix:** First-run **beat-pinch** + knuckle-span; store per-user profile.

6. **Only visual testing** → passes unit tests, fails in demos.
   **Fix:** Golden video + telemetry replays; publish overlays on PRs.

# Is “distributed hexagonal microservices + CI/CD” a good idea?

**Yes, if you start local-first.**

* Start with **hexagonal DDD** and **workers** (local distribution). You get isolation, reproducible tests, and low operational overhead.
* Move a worker out-of-process only when needed (e.g., GPU landmarking service). This preserves latency while giving you the option to scale later.

If you jump straight to networked microservices, you’ll add latency and ops work for little benefit right now.

# Concrete next steps (2–3 days)

1. **Define the DDD model** (TS only): `Controller`, `Pinch`, `Clock`, `TTC`, `Profile`; domain events.
2. **Spin up workers**: `sensing-worker` → `tracking-worker` → `domain-worker` → `emit-worker`.
3. **Clock**: create `AudioContext({latencyHint:'interactive'})`; expose `now()` from audio time; report `baseLatency`. ([MDN Web Docs][4])
4. **Filters**: implement One-Euro with saved params; add test vectors. ([ACM Digital Library][6])
5. **ID matching**: greedy first, switchable to Hungarian; test with occlusions. ([Wikipedia][2])
6. **Calibration**: beat-pinch to estimate phase + fixed offset; knuckle-span capture.
7. **CI**: add two golden videos (good light, occlusion), one fast-motion; PR must replay and match event timelines.
8. **Emission**: WebMIDI path (permission gates) + simple synth via AudioWorklet for round-trip tests. ([Chrome for Developers][3], [MDN Web Docs][8])

If you want, I can draft a **DDD folder layout + message schemas** and a **worker wiring skeleton** you can paste into your repo next.
