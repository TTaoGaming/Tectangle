Absolutely. Below are copy-pasteable prompts‚Äîone per Champion‚Äîwritten in plain language and tailored for a dark, hive-fleet aesthetic. Each keeps a shared visual ‚Äúuniverse,‚Äù but lets the Champion set their own vibe. Use as-is, or tweak colors/aspect ratios. I‚Äôve included a short version first (for quick runs) and a detailed version (for best results).

### Quick usage tips

* If the model allows, add **aspect** (portraits 4:5 or 1:1; action 16:9 for Window Hunter).
* For a matching set, append the **Global style** to each.
* Want more variety? Change accent colors or camera angle (front, ¬æ, low-angle) per Champion.

When you‚Äôre ready, I can bundle these into a single `CHAMPIONS_PROMPTS.yaml` so you can run batches easily.

Here‚Äôs a copy-paste **AGENT\_ROSTER.md** you can test immediately. It‚Äôs plain, compact, and includes: a global system preface, your persona, the **core council (4)**, the **always-on pair (2)**, plus the **extended roster**. Each champion has: a 3-line intro, biases, a **summon phrase**, a **seat-claim** + **counsel** template, and a ready-to-use **image prompt**.

# AGENT\_ROSTER.md ‚Äî TTao, Lord of Strings (Obsidian Nest)

## 0) Global system preface (paste as ‚Äúsystem‚Äù in your agent)

You are the **Obsidian Nest Orchestrator** for **TTao, Lord of Strings**. Build a small **gameboard** (state‚Äìaction space) from the user‚Äôs inputs, then run a **self-organizing council** of four seats: **‚õ∞ Exploit, üî• Explore, üíß Pivot, üí® Reorient**. For each seat, admit the champion with the best one-line fit and a tiny proof. Keep cognitive load low: return (1) board snapshot (current, goal, constraint), (2) four counsel cards, (3) one chosen Exploit with a pass/fail check, (4) a short history line (**Snapshot ‚Üí Result ‚Üí Lesson**). Use plain language.

**One-minute loop:** Gate ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Council ‚Üí Choose ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Archive.

## 5) Tiny ‚Äúboard‚Äù & ‚Äúcounsel‚Äù payloads (what your agent should emit)

**Board (example):**

```json
{
  "board": {
    "problem": "Pinch feels slow on mid-range phones.",
    "metric": "median trigger delay (ms) ‚Üì",
    "constraint": "30 FPS, 480p, no new deps",
    "current": "distance+heavy smoothing",
    "goals": {"1h":"feel snappier","1d":"-30% delay","1w":"stable on 2 devices"},
    "wires": ["lighter smoothing preset","time-to-touch (TTC)","debounce+release hysteresis"]
  }
}
```

**Counsel set (example):**

```json
{
  "exploit": {"what":"Enable debounce + release hysteresis","why":"kills double-fires today","win":"false doubles ‚Üì to ‚â§1 per 2 min clip","warnings":"+5‚Äì10ms debounce","how":["add debounce 60ms","release at 55%","verify on clip A"]},
  "explore": {"what":"Check TTC on 1 clip","why":"predict pinch earlier","win":"‚â•30% sooner with no new false","warnings":"clip bias","how":["compute rel velocity","estimate TTC","compare"]},
  "pivot": {"what":"Switch to TTC path behind flag","why":"faster trigger on same hardware","win":"EV_new>EV_old on clip A/B","warnings":"bad TTC on occlusion","how":["feature flag","run A/B","keep only if win"]},
  "reorient": {"what":"Adopt stage order + port names","why":"less tangle, easier tests","win":"all stages visible; one test green","warnings":"minor refactor","how":["expose ports","add debug toggles","write 1 smoke test"]}
}
```

**Choice + Archive (example):**

```json
{
  "choice":{"exploit_label":"debounce+hysteresis","ev":{"impact":0.6,"confidence":0.8,"cost":0.1,"risk":0.1,"composite":2.4}},
  "history_append":{"snapshot":"Pinch lag; ship debounce+hys.","metric_delta":"false doubles 7‚Üí1","lesson":"Guardrails first made tuning easier."}
}
```

---

## 6) Quick test script (paste as a single user message)

```
Problem: Pinch feels slow on mid-range phones.
Metric: median trigger delay (ms) ‚Üì
Constraint: 30 FPS, 480p, no new dependencies
Horizons: 1h=snappier feel; 1d=-30% delay; 1w=stable on 2 devices
Assets/Blocks: clips A/B; EMA too heavy; no GPU

Run the 1-minute loop with the core council. 
Return: board snapshot, four counsel cards, one chosen exploit with a simple pass/fail check, and a one-line history entry.
Keep it plain and short.
```

If you want this saved as a file, say ‚Äúexport AGENT\_ROSTER.md‚Äù, and I‚Äôll attach it as a downloadable.

Awesome‚Äîlet‚Äôs turn the **Obsidian Nest** + Champions into a working graph you can actually run.

Below is a **practical, copy-pasteable blueprint** for **LangGraph (Python)**, plus quick notes for other orchestrators. It‚Äôs opinionated, minimal, and easy to extend. Start with the **Core 6** (the four council seats + Steward + Scribe), then add the extended roster when you want.

---

# A) Minimal architecture (plain language)

* **State (single source of truth):**
  `board` (problem, metric, constraint, horizons), `counsel` (cards from seats), `choice` (one exploit to run), `history` (Snapshot‚ÜíResult‚ÜíLesson), `config` (weights/limits), `attachments` (clips, logs).

* **1-minute loop (nodes):**
  `gate` ‚Üí `build_board` ‚Üí **parallel seats** (`explore`, `pivot`, `reorient`) ‚Üí `merge_counsel` ‚Üí `decide_exploit` ‚Üí `execute_exploit` ‚Üí `steward_guardrail` ‚Üí `scribe_archive` ‚Üí `END`.

* **Champions as nodes:** each champion is a small wrapper around your LLM with its **persona prompt**, **inputs** it needs, and **JSON schema** it must return (so it‚Äôs easy to score/merge).

* **Guardrails:** max 4 counsel cards; ‚â§3 micro-tests total; rollback for risky actions; Steward can add a single guardrail per loop; Scribe always logs.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = build_graph()
    state: NestState = {
        "board": {
            "problem": "Pinch feels slow on mid-range phones.",
            "metric": "median_trigger_delay_ms ‚Üì",
            "constraint": "30 FPS, 480p, no new deps",

```

**What you get:** a loop that (1) builds the board, (2) runs **Explore/Pivot/Reorient** in parallel, (3) **chooses one Exploit**, (4) adds a Steward guardrail, (5) logs with Scribe. Champions speak in their own voices because each sits behind its **persona system prompt**.

---

# C) Plugging tools & tests

### Tools (where to wire your real code)

* **execute\_exploit:** flip a feature flag, run a mini pipeline, or call your pinch metrics function.
* **explore/pivot:** expose tool calls like `compute_ttc(clip)`, `compare_smoothing(raw)`, etc., via LangChain tools and allow those tools for specific champions.

### TDD smoke tests (fast)

* Unit: `decide_exploit` computes EV score and picks highest.
* Contract: every champion returns the JSON schema (seat/who/what/‚Ä¶/ev).
* E2E smoke: run the graph with a **fixed board** and assert:

  * 3 counsel cards exist before decide,
  * `choice` exists with `ev.score`,
  * `history` grew by 1.

---

# D) How to extend (extended roster)

Add nodes exactly like above, but **off-council**:

* **Honeycomb Smith (scaffold)** node you can insert **before** any risky changes.
* **Window Hunter (finisher)** to ship a cut on a deadline.
* **Safebreaker (rule-unlock)** to run a flag/sandbox experiment.
* **First Principles (clarity)** to reset when messy.
* **Swarm Jester / Concord Weaver / Signal Warden / Shadow Auditor** similarly.

Route them via a **conditional edge** (e.g., if `state["board"]["constraint"].lower()` contains `"deadline"` ‚Üí call **Window Hunter** before decide).

---

# E) Other orchestrators (quick mappings)

* **Autogen**: create Agents with the same **persona system prompts**, put them in a `GroupChat`, and assign a Manager agent to (a) set the board, (b) request proposals from Explorer/Pivot/Reorient, (c) ask Ruler to pick 1 exploit, (d) ask Scribe to log. Parallellism via `concurrent=True` on tasks.

* **OpenAI Assistants API**: define Assistants per champion, each with its prompt + allowed tools. Or one Assistant that **swaps system prompts** per turn. Use `parallel_tool_calls` for Explorer/Pivot/Reorient; then a `ruler_decider` function.

* **CrewAI / Semantic Kernel**: one ‚ÄúCrew/Skills‚Äù per champion with goals & tools; a conductor enforces the 1-minute loop and picks 4 seats per turn.

---

# F) Your persona baked in (system preface)

Paste at the top of your orchestrator:

> **System:** You are the **Obsidian Nest Orchestrator** for **TTao, Lord of Strings**‚Äîa shielded controller who wins by information, positioning, and one decisive strike. Build a small **gameboard** from inputs (problem, metric, constraint, horizons). Run a **4-seat council**: **Exploit, Explore, Pivot, Reorient**. Keep cognitive load low: plain language, one page. Output: (1) board snapshot, (2) 3 counsel cards (explore/pivot/reorient), (3) 1 exploit card with a pass/fail check, (4) one history line (**Snapshot ‚Üí Result ‚Üí Lesson**). Add **one small guardrail** if needed. No jargon.

---

# G) What to do next (5-minute plan)

1. **Copy** `obsidian_nest.py` and set your model key/env.
2. **Run** the script once‚Äîconfirm you get 4 cards + history.
3. **Wire** one real tool into `execute_exploit` (e.g., toggle debounce + hysteresis).
4. **Add** a smoke test that checks the history line increments and the exploit label matches expectations.
5. **Extend** with `Honeycomb Smith` before risky refactors, and `Window Hunter` on deadlines.

If you want, I can also provide a **TypeScript** version using **LangGraph TS** or an **Autogen** group chat file‚Äîjust say which stack you‚Äôd like next.


Alright, Lord of Strings‚Äîlet‚Äôs build your Memory Palace and walk it together. We‚Äôll tour each chamber in order. At each stop you‚Äôll get (1) a short scene, (2) a quick role-play line, and (3) a **copy-paste image prompt** to render that place or champion.

6. **Scribe:** ‚Äúaction=‚Ä¶ before=‚Ä¶ after=‚Ä¶ lesson=‚Ä¶‚Äù

That‚Äôs your palace. If you want, I‚Äôll package this as `NEST_MEMORY_PALACE.md` so you can keep it open while you work.

Love it. Let‚Äôs ship a **‚Äúworks-today‚Äù** version that‚Äôs dead simple in VS Code, and level it up later.

Below is a **Tiered path**. Tier-1 is a single-file Node CLI you can run in minutes (Copilot/Codex/Kilo friendly). You can paste this straight into your repo and go. Later, we can swap the core for LangGraph without changing your rituals.

---

# TL;DR ‚Äî Best path today

* **Tier-0 (fastest, manual):** Use the *Champion Macros* (prompts) inside Copilot/Codex chat. Good for brainstorming; no structure.
* **Tier-1 (recommended now):** **One-file Node ‚ÄúNest CLI‚Äù** that runs your council **sequentially** (Explore ‚Üí Pivot ‚Üí Reorient ‚Üí Exploit + Steward + Scribe), writes `nest_out.json` + `nest_out.md`. Easy to extend, no new infra.
* **Tier-2 (next):** Swap the CLI core to **LangGraph** for parallel seats + tool calling, but keep the same board JSON and champion prompts.
* **Tier-3 (later):** Add adapters (hex ports), CI smoke, and tool bindings (golden replay, TTC calc, etc.).

---

## Tier-1: One-file ‚ÄúNest CLI‚Äù (Node)

**1) Create `obsidian-nest.mjs`** (single file)

  console.log("‚úì Wrote nest_out.json and nest_out.md");
}

run().catch(e => { console.error(e); process.exit(1); });
```

**2) Add a sample `board.json`** (based on your Consolidated Pinch Report)

```json
{
  "problem": "Demo pages fail at bootstrap; pinch feels laggy; no telemetry.",
  "metric": "demo_unblocked && median_trigger_delay_ms ‚Üì",
  "constraint": "ship fast; reuse tests/goldens; 480p@30fps; no heavy deps",
  "current": "distance + heavy smoothing; fragile bootstrap",
  "horizons": {
    "h1": "demo loads; manual smoke OK",
    "d1": "pinch‚Üíkeypress bridge; first golden replay",
    "w1": "CI headless smoke + clamp + optional TTC; -30% delay",
    "m1": "hexagonal pinch core with ports & golden parity gate"
  },
  "assets": ["clips A/B", "golden traces"],
  "blocks": ["unguarded top-level await", "CJS/ESM mix"]
}
```

**3) Install deps & run**

```bash
npm init -y
npm i openai
# set your API key: export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
node obsidian-nest.mjs board.json
# => creates nest_out.json + nest_out.md
```

**4) (Optional) VS Code task** `.vscode/tasks.json`

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Obsidian Nest: run council",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "node obsidian-nest.mjs board.json",
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": "build"
    }
  ]
}
```

Run with `Terminal ‚Üí Run Task ‚Üí Obsidian Nest: run council`.

## Tier-0: Champion Macros (for Copilot/Codex chat)

Paste one of these when you just want the voice without the CLI:

**Sovereign (Exploit) Macro**

```
You are Thread Sovereign (Ruler/Exploit).
Pick exactly ONE safe, reversible step that moves the metric TODAY.
Return 5 bullets: What / Why / Win (pass/fail) / Warnings / How(3).
Board: <paste your board json>
```

**Seeker (Explore) Macro**

```
You are Faultline Seeker (Explore).
Design 1‚Äì3 tiny checks to kill the riskiest assumption fast.
Each check has input, stop rule, expected signal.
Return 5 bullets: What probes / Why / Stop rules / Risk / Next step.
Board: <paste board json>
```

(Prism/Cartographer macros similar.)

---

## Level-up path (keep the same board.json)

1. **LangGraph swap (parallel seats):** Replace the CLI with LangGraph using the same personas and output schema. Wire tools (golden replay, TTC calc) to specific champions.
2. **Ports & adapters (Hex):** Extract `PinchCore` and define `CameraPort`, `TelemetryPort`, `UIBridgePort`. Your CLI (or LangGraph) passes events through adapters; CI runs golden parity on the core.
3. **CI smoke:** Add a Puppeteer job that boots the demo, asserts **no unhandled rejections**, and replays a golden trace; fail on envelope drift.
4. **Tool bindings:** Map commands like `compute_ttc`, `replay_golden`, `measure_latency` as callable tools the champions can invoke.
5. **History store:** Append each loop‚Äôs `history` into `docs/knowledge/nest_history.jsonl` for longitudinal learning.

---

## Why this is the ‚Äúbest today‚Äù

* **Minimal glue:** one file, one JSON board, standard OpenAI SDK. Works inside VS Code with Copilot/Codex/Kilo.
* **Sequential first:** predictable outputs; easy to diff in PRs (`nest_out.md`).
* **Upgradable:** same prompts/data shape moves straight into LangGraph later (no rewrites).
* **Fits your pinch plan:** Sovereign ships the bootstrap guard + bridge; Seeker proves it; Prism stages TTC flag; Steward adds debounce/hysteresis; Scribe logs. Exactly your report.

If you want, I can also drop a **LangGraph Python** version matching this schema, but this single-file Node CLI will get you moving immediately.
