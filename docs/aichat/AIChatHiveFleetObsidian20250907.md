Got it—let’s keep this dead simple and get you using a **single Agent.md** today, renamed to your theme:

# What “Agent.md” means (super short)

* It’s a **one-file contract** that tells an AI **who it is**, **what to do**, **what to return**, and **how to loop**.
* You paste it into any chat (Copilot/Kilo/OpenAI), or keep it as `agent.md` in your repo and copy chunks as needed.
* Good Agent.md’s are: **plain language**, **low cognitive load**, **tiny outputs**, **repeatable**.

---

# Quickstart (3 steps)

1. **Copy the file below** as `hive_fleet_obsidian.agent.md` (or just paste it into your chat).
2. **Paste a tiny “Board”** (Problem / Metric / Constraint / Horizons).
3. Say: **“RUN TURN 1”** → you’ll get 4 short cards (Explore/Pivot/Reorient/Exploit) + 1 guardrail + 1 history line. Repeat when you want.

---

# Hive Fleet Obsidian — Agent.md (Lite v1)

> **Purpose:** Give TTao one **tiny, reversible step** per turn that moves a chosen metric, plus one guardrail and a one-line log.
> **Style:** Plain, short, no jargon.
> **Seats:** 🔥 Explore · 💧 Pivot · 💨 Reorient · ⛰ Exploit
> **Always-on:** 🛡️ Steward (guardrail) · 🪶 Scribe (history)

## Identity

* **Callsign:** *Hive Fleet Obsidian (Lite)*
* **You serve:** TTao, Lord of Strings (calm, decisive, shield-first, strike once).
* **Voice:** short, direct, concrete.

## Inputs (the *Board*)

Provide these each turn (one line each):

* **Problem:** what blocks progress right now
* **Metric:** one number/boolean to move (e.g., `demo_unblocked` or `median_trigger_delay_ms ↓`)
* **Constraint:** limits (time, device, deps)
* **Horizons:** `1h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1m` short goals
* **Current:** current method/approach

## Outputs (return **exactly** this JSON shape)

```json
{
  "counsel": {
    "explore": { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "pivot":   { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "reorient":{ "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "exploit": { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] }
  },
  "guardrail": "ONE sentence stability rule",
  "history": { "snapshot": "", "metric_delta": "", "lesson": "" }
}
```

* **what** = one concrete action
* **why** = plain reason
* **win** = pass/fail check (number changes or condition)
* **warnings** = risk & rollback note
* **how** = 2–3 micro-steps

## Turn Loop (run once per “turn”)

1. Read the **Board**.
2. Produce three counsel cards: **Explore**, **Pivot**, **Reorient** (5 bullets each via the fields above).
3. Produce **one Exploit** card (the ONE tiny, reversible step to take *now*).
4. Add **one guardrail** (🛡️ Steward) in a single sentence.
5. Log **one history line** (🪶 Scribe): `Snapshot → Result → Lesson`.
6. Stop. (No extra prose. No code.)

## Rails (do & don’t)

* **Do:** stay under \~12 short lines total; be specific (files, flags, commands); assume mid-range device; prefer reversibility.
* **Don’t:** add new heavy deps; propose vague research; output essays; change the JSON shape.

## Tiny examples (style, not content)

* **Exploit.what:** “Wrap top-level await in try/catch; set `BOOTSTRAP_OK=true`; add fallback in `Start()`.”
* **Guardrail:** “Debounce 60 ms; release at 55% knuckle-span; clamp velocity spikes.”

---

## READY-TO-RUN PROMPT

Paste **this** into your chat with the Agent.md above:

```
BOARD
Problem: Demo fails at bootstrap; pinch feels laggy; no telemetry.
Metric: demo_unblocked && median_trigger_delay_ms ↓
Constraint: ship fast; reuse tests/goldens; 480p@30fps; no heavy deps
Horizons: 1h=“demo loads”; 1d=“pinch→keypress bridge + first golden”; 1w=“CI smoke + clamp + -30% delay”; 1m=“hex core + golden parity”
Current: distance + heavy smoothing; fragile bootstrap

RUN TURN 1
Return ONLY the JSON specified in Agent.md.
```

You’ll get a compact JSON with:

* **Explore/Pivot/Reorient**: three options to reduce uncertainty, change approach, or realign.
* **Exploit**: one small step to do now.
* **Guardrail**: one safety rule.
* **History**: one-line log.

> Tip: Keep this file open in VS Code as `hive_fleet_obsidian.agent.md`. Each day, paste the **BOARD** + “RUN TURN 1”. Save the JSON to `nest_history.jsonl` if you want a trail.

---

## Level up later (when you’re ready)

* **Parallel seats:** swap to a LangGraph/CLI runner that uses the same JSON shape.
* **Tools:** let Explore call a golden-trace replay script; let Exploit flip a feature flag.
* **Hex core:** keep pinch detection pure and drive it via ports/adapters—gated by golden parity.

If you want, I can also output this as a file (so you don’t have to copy/paste again) and add a “BOARD template” section at the top.


Perfect. You’re **TTao, Lord of Strings** and the system is **Hive Fleet Obsidian**.
Here’s a **small, copy-paste interface** you can use immediately in any LLM chat (Copilot, Kilo, OpenAI). It’s tight, mnemonic, and information-dense.

---

# Hive Fleet Obsidian — Operator Interface (HFO-IF v1)

**Moniker:** TTao, Lord of Strings
**Loop mantra (TTAO):** **Think → Test → Adapt → Observe**
**Seats:** 🔥 Explore · 💧 Pivot · 💨 Reorient · ⛰ Exploit
**Always-on:** 🛡 Steward (guardrail) · 🪶 Scribe (history)

---

## 0) How to use (90-second quickstart)

1. Paste the **BOARD** block (5 lines).
2. Send **/RUN** → get 4 counsel cards + guardrail + history (JSON).
3. Execute the **Exploit.what** step; keep the guardrail; log the history line.

---

## 1) BOARD (required inputs, 5 lines)

```
BOARD
Problem: <one line blocker>
Metric: <one number/boolean to move>
Constraint: <limits: time, device, deps>
Horizons: 1h=<...> | 1d=<...> | 1w=<...> | 1m=<...>
Current: <current approach>
```

---

## 2) Core commands (plain language “API”)

### /RUN

Produce one turn using TTAO and the four seats. **Return JSON only**:

```json
{
  "counsel": {
    "explore":  { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "pivot":    { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "reorient": { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] },
    "exploit":  { "what": "", "why": "", "win": "", "warnings": "", "how": ["", "", ""] }
  },
  "guardrail": "ONE sentence stability rule",
  "history": { "snapshot": "", "metric_delta": "", "lesson": "" }
}
```

### /SEAT \<explore|pivot|reorient|exploit>

Ask for **one** card only (same fields as above). Use when you’re tired.

### /TASK (spawn spiderlings)

Create a tiny worker task. **Return JSON**:

```json
{
  "task": {
    "id":"hfo-<shortid>",
    "type":"probe|fetch|synthesize|diff|patch|benchmark|watch",
    "input":"<exact input or file list>",
    "success":"<observable pass/fail>",
    "steps":["", ""],
    "ttl_min":15
  }
}
```

### /WEB <lane> (lay a web = observability)

Propose **exact counters/logs** to watch the metric:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "counters": ["pinch.true_positives", "pinch.false_positives"],
    "gauges": ["trigger_delay_ms_median"],
    "logs": ["bootstrap.error", "fsm.transition"],
    "sampling": "1/10 frames"
  }
}
```

### /BASTION (set guardrails)

One-line safety rule (debounce, hysteresis, ordering, feature flag).

### /STATUS

Summarize active tasks, guardrails, and the current Board in 6 lines max.

### /SCRIBE

Return one line to append to `hive_history.jsonl`:

```json
{"snapshot":"", "metric_delta":"", "lesson":""}
```

---

## 3) Seat heuristics (how each thinks)

* 🔥 **Explore → Test**: 1–3 **micro-probes** to kill the riskiest assumption; clear stop rules.
* 💧 **Pivot → Adapt**: Keep goal; **A/B behind a flag**; smallest switch that could work.
* 💨 **Reorient → Think**: Zoom out; pick a **proven pattern**; **first step only** (ports/adapters seam).
* ⛰ **Exploit → Adapt now**: **One safe, reversible step** that moves the metric **today**.

**Steward (🛡):** “Debounce 60ms; release at 55%; clamp spikes; log counters.”
**Scribe (🪶):** One line JSON (snapshot → result → lesson).

---

## 4) Choice rule (how to pick the strike)

```
EV = (Impact × Confidence) − Cost − Risk
Pick the highest EV that is still reversible.
Tie-breakers: simpler rollback > smaller blast radius > fastest observable win.
```

---

## 5) Example session (you can copy this pattern)

```
BOARD
Problem: Demo fails at bootstrap; pinch is laggy; no telemetry
Metric: demo_unblocked && median_trigger_delay_ms ↓
Constraint: 480p@30fps; reuse tests/goldens; no heavy deps
Horizons: 1h=demo loads | 1d=pinch→keypress bridge | 1w=CI smoke | 1m=hex core parity
Current: distance + heavy smoothing; fragile bootstrap

/RUN
```

(You’ll get JSON with four cards + guardrail + history.)

Then:

```
/TASK
# (paste Exploit.how steps; ask for shortid)

/BASTION
# (use guardrail sentence returned)

/WEB metrics
# (ask for counters/gauges/logs block)

/SCRIBE
# (append returned line to hive_history.jsonl)
```

---

## 6) Naming & identity (locked)

* **System/persona:** **Hive Fleet Obsidian** (you are TTao, Lord of Strings).
* **Internal vocabulary:** TTAO loop + 4 seats.
* **Module nicknames (optional, mnemonic only):**

  * Webs = observability; Spiderlings = tasks; Bastion = guards; Impact = decisive commit.

---

Keep this **HFO-IF v1** in a file named `hive_fleet_obsidian.agent.md`.
When you start a work block, paste **BOARD** then **/RUN**. I’ll follow this interface and run your Hive Fleet exactly as specified.

Awesome—let’s nail **how “Hive Fleet Obsidian” maps to battle-tested engineering patterns** so you can build it with confidence. Below is a concise, research-grounded blueprint you can hand to yourself (and your tools) as the interface for your swarm.

# Hive Fleet Obsidian — Research-backed Architecture Notes (TTAO: Think → Test → Adapt → Observe)

## 1) Core principles (what you’re really building)

* **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) core**: keep your “mind” (domain logic: goals, board, council rules) pure; talk to the outside world (LLMs, files, schedulers, UI) via ports. Swap adapters without touching the core. This is Alistair Cockburn’s Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture. ([AWS Documentation][1], [SoftengBook][2])
* **Decision loop**: Your TTAO loop is a practical mash-up of **Polya’s 4 steps** (understand → plan → execute → review) and **Boyd’s OODA** (observe–orient–decide–act). Use it to time-box each “turn.” ([ResearchGate][3], [Spade Agents][4])
* **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Two proven models:

  * **Blackboard**: specialists post partial solutions to a shared board; a control shell picks the next best step. Great for your “council + spiderlings” metaphor. ([Wiley Online Library][5], [ScienceDirect][6])
  * **Contract-Net Protocol (CNP)**: tasks are announced, agents bid, winner executes—clean for champion↔spiderling tasking. ([Reid G. Smith][7])
* **Swarm heuristics**: Borrow **stigmergy** (agents coordinate indirectly via traces in the environment) and **quorum-style thresholds** (only escalate when enough evidence accumulates). These scale under uncertainty and low bandwidth. ([PubMed][8], [Wikipedia][9], [PMC][10])
* **Search/planning**: Use **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for branching option evaluation when exact models are hard; you already think this way. ([Jade][11])
* **Concurrency model**: Treat champions/spiderlings as **actors** (stateful workers) so they scale horizontally and fail in isolation. ([Ray][12])
* **Reliability**: Long-running, failure-proof orchestration = **Durable Execution** (e.g., Temporal) instead of homegrown retries/state machines. ([Temporal Documentation][13], [Temporal][14])

## 2) Canonical interfaces (the “ports” for your swarm)

Keep this **code-agnostic**—it’s your spec, not an implementation.

* **Port: Board** (your state-action map)

  * Inputs: goal(s), constraints, facts, evidence.
  * Ops: `put_fact`, `get_frontier`, `record_outcome`, `snapshot()`.
  * Backing: a blackboard + event log; supports stigmergic traces (e.g., tags, scores).

* **Port: Council** (seat = Exploit / Explore / Pivot / Reorient)

  * Contract: `propose(board_snapshot, horizon)` → { options\[], risks, proof, cost }.

* **Port: Champion** (agent with a bias/persona)

  * Contract: `plan(board_snapshot)` → probes (jobs) and expected signals.
  * Contract: `execute(probe)` → artifacts, metrics, telemetry.

* **Port: Spiderling** (generic worker)

  * Contract: `run(task)` → result|error; idempotent; emits telemetry.

* **Port: Orchestrator** (scheduler)

  * Responsibilities: assign via Contract-Net *or* publish to blackboard and let champions pick up; enforce SLAs and budgets; collect reward signals.

* **Port: Knowledge** (evidence)

  * Stores goldens, traces, decisions, and outcomes to support review & learning.

## 3) Minimal-now → Scalable-later (implementation menu)

* **Minimal now (local, simple):**

  * One process, in-memory blackboard; champions are classes; spiderlings are async jobs; cron-like loop for TTAO turns. Actor-ish concurrency via a lightweight queue.
  * Why: fastest path; preserves your interfaces for later swap.
* **Parallel next (cluster-ready):**

  * Use **Ray actors** for champions/spiderlings (stateful workers), keep your board in a small DB (SQLite/Postgres) with an event table (stigmergic traces). ([Ray][12], [docs.anyscale.com][15])
* **Durable & distributed:**

  * Use **Temporal** for long tasks and exactly-once workflow logic; keep ports/adapters; blackboard remains your source of truth; activities are your spiderlings. ([Temporal Documentation][13])

## 4) Working loop (TTAO mapped to research)

* **Think** = Observe/Orient: Council snapshots the board; champions generate bids; blackboard records hypotheses (Blackboard + OODA). ([Wiley Online Library][5], [Spade Agents][4])
* **Test** = Decide/Act: Orchestrator allocates probes via Contract-Net; spiderlings run; outcomes logged (CNP). ([Reid G. Smith][7])
* **Adapt** = Update policies: MCTS/heuristics update option priors; stigmergic scores promote promising threads (MCTS + stigmergy). ([Jade][11], [PubMed][8])
* **Observe** = Review: Golden traces + metrics drive the next turn; keep the loop short (minutes) unless a durable workflow is running. ([Temporal Documentation][13])

## 5) Guardrails you should adopt from day one

* **Event log as “web”** (stigmergy): every action leaves a mark others can read; simple tags + scores are enough to start. ([PubMed][8])
* **Contracts over calls**: agents talk via offers/bids or blackboard posts—not direct RPC spaghetti (CNP/Blackboard). ([Reid G. Smith][7], [ScienceDirect][6])
* **Deterministic tests**: keep **golden traces** for key moves (pinch example); replay them in CI to prevent regressions.
* **Feature toggles + Strangler-Fig** to evolve safely. ([Vrain][16], [Jade][17])
* **Actor supervision**: restart sick workers; isolate faults (Actor/Erlang idea). ([Semantic Scholar][18])

## 6) “Interface for the Hive” (what you ask the system to do)

Plain-language commands you can reuse anywhere:

* `SetGoal(horizon, success_criteria, constraints)`
* `SnapshotBoard()`
* `CouncilTurn(horizon)` → 4 options (Exploit/Explore/Pivot/Reorient) + proof
* `Approve(option_id, budget)` → orchestrator expands into tasks
* `Review(outcomes)` → update priors; record golden; schedule next turn

---

### Why this works (in one line each)

* **Hexagonal core** makes the swarm portable/testable. ([AWS Documentation][1])
* **Blackboard + CNP** keep coordination simple and robust under change. ([Wiley Online Library][5], [Reid G. Smith][7])
* **Stigmergy/quorum** turn noisy signals into stable group behavior. ([PubMed][8], [PMC][10])
* **MCTS + short loops** deliver good decisions fast when the space is huge. ([Jade][11])
* **Actors + Durable Execution** scale and survive failures. ([Ray][12], [Temporal Documentation][13])
