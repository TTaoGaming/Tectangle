# Agent — Project State Snapshot

TLDR: Current workspace scanned; inventory and tooling reports created; 12-doc canonicalization proposal executed (10 moved, 2 failed). This file summarizes state, successes, failures, and next steps.

Overview

- Generated inventory: [`docs/doc_inventory.json`](./doc_inventory.json) (machine-readable) and [`docs/doc_inventory.md`](./doc_inventory.md) (human wrapper).
- Tooling report: [`docs/tooling_environment_report.json`](./tooling_environment_report.json) / [`docs/tooling_environment_report.md`](./tooling_environment_report.md).
- Canonicalization proposal: [`docs/knowledge/migration_proposal.md`](./knowledge/migration_proposal.md).
- Snapshot manifest (latest run): [`archive-stale/migration_snapshot_20250906T225754Z/manifest.json`](../archive-stale/migration_snapshot_20250906T225754Z/manifest.json).
- Canonicalization human report: [`docs/knowledge/canonicalization_report_20250906T225754Z.md`](./knowledge/canonicalization_report_20250906T225754Z.md).

Current counts (from inventory extract)

- Total .md/.txt files cataloged: 7064
- Classification: Gold: 665; Reference: 4924; AI-slop: 1475

Recent actions (automated)

1. Full inventory generated (JSON + MD).
2. Tooling environment audit produced.
3. Migration proposal created and canonicalization executed for 12 candidates (10 moved, 2 failed). Backups stored under `archive-stale/` (manifest above).

Successes (what is done)

- Deterministic inventory of docs (machine-readable) — enables programmatic selection.
- Tooling/environment snapshot identifies headless browser libs and local capabilities.
- First canonicalization pass moved high-value Gold docs into `docs/knowledge/` with backups.

Failures / open issues

- 2 canonicalization candidates failed (see snapshot manifest entries for errors).
- Demos may still fail due to bootstrap/ESM/CJS mismatches (triage: [`September2025/Tectangle/diagnostics/TESTS_VS_DEMO_ROOT_CAUSE_2025-09-06.md`](../September2025/Tectangle/diagnostics/TESTS_VS_DEMO_ROOT_CAUSE_2025-09-06.md)).
- Git history and large archive monolith not yet fully processed for timeline extraction.

Recommended immediate next steps

1. Create a 6–7 month timeline from git commits (requires repo .git access). I can run this if you confirm I may read git history.
2. Deep-scan archives/index monolith for additional timestamps and artifacts (requires permission and time; may be slow).
3. Prepare a clean dev environment blueprint (`devcontainer` or Docker) to stabilize reproducible runs and support parallel AI agents.

How you can proceed

- If you want the timeline now, confirm: "Read git history and build timeline".
- If you prefer a deep archive scan first, say: "Deep scan archives".
- To set up the dev environment blueprint, say: "Create dev environment".

Agent memory update

- I will store this snapshot in the agent manifest as the current workspace state (inventory counts, last-canonicalization timestamp, snapshot manifest path). Confirm if you want this persisted.
